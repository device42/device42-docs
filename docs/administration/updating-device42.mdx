## How to Update the Device42 Main Appliance

To update your Main Appliance, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the update file or URL via email.
2. Back up your Device42 data in the Appliance Manager.
3. Upload the update file or enter the update URL in the Appliance Manager.
4. Log in to the Virtual Machine (VM) console.
5. Apply the update from the VM console.
6. Verify the update from the Main Appliance.

Watch the quick [How To Update the Device42 Main Appliance](how-to-videos/update-device42-appliance-how-to.mdx) walkthrough video of the process.
:::

### 1. Obtain the Upgrade File or URL 

To update the Main Appliance, you need to download the update file. In some cases, technical support may have emailed you an update URL to use instead of the update file. If you've received an email with an update URL, proceed to the next step: [Back Up Your Data](#back-up-your-data).

-  From the Main Appliance, navigate to **Tools > Settings > Update** and click the [**Check for latest version** link](https://www.device42.com/update/). 

    You can visit [https://www.device42.com/update/](https://www.device42.com/update/) directly, but navigating to the link on the **Update Software** page allows you to take note of your current version, which is useful for verifying a successful update later.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/updating-device42/update-software-19.06-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Fill in the form on the website and click **Download update**. 

    ![Website form](/assets/images/updating-device42/website-form-19.06.png)

- You'll receive an automated email with several links to download the `.zip.enc` file. If your Main Appliance has already been updated to the latest [major](https://semver.org/) version and you're applying a minor or patch-release update, or if your MA's latest update was to a major version, choose the first link (in bold).

    If your Main Appliance is one or several releases behind the current major version, choose the second or third link, depending on your version, to first update it to the major version. When you've updated to the latest major version, you may need to perform a second update to the current minor or patch-release version afterward.

### 2. Back Up Your Data

Head to the Appliance Manager by entering `http://your-device42-IP-or-FQDN:4242` or `https://your-device42-IP-or-FQDN:4343` into your browser. Optionally, you can take a virtual machine snapshot from your virtualization platform as a backup.

:::note
The default credentials for the Appliance Manager are `d42admin / default`, or for AWS instances, `d42admin / AWS_INSTANCE_ID`. Please ensure you change the `default` password to your own secure credentials.
:::

Navigate to **Backup/Restore > Backup Now** and select the **Main Appliance** checkbox. If you want to include users and settings, select the **Backup Meta Data** option. **Run** the backup.

For an explanation of the backup options, see the [Backup via the Appliance Manager](appliance-manager/setting-up-backup-device42-appliance-manager.mdx) page.

### 3. Upload the Update File

From the Main Appliance, navigate to **Application > Update Software** and **either** browse and upload the [`.zip.enc` file](#obtain-the-update-file-or-url) **or** enter the update URL.

![Upload file or enter URL in the Appliance Manager](/assets/images/updating-device42/upload-file-19.06.png)

A green status bar indicates the upload progress.

When the file has been uploaded, log in to the VM console.

### 4. Log In to the VM Console

There are two ways to log in to the VM console:

1. Access the VM console through your virtual platform.
2. **Via SSH:** 

     - Use port 404 on the Device42 IP address.
     - If you're using a power appliance, use port 442.
     - For AWS deployments, SSH in to the device using `device42` as your username and `AWS-KEYFILE` as your password. For example:

     ```shell
     ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem -p port_number username@hostname
     ```

### 5. Apply the Update 

Select option **a** in the console to apply the update. It usually takes 15 to 30 minutes to apply the update.

## Updating the Remote Collectors

As long as your Remote Collectors are connected to a Device42 Main Appliance, any updates will be automatically applied to the Remote Collectors when the Main Appliance is updated.

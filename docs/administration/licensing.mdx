### How Do I Apply My License?

### How Do I Know When My License Expires?

You can check the **License Valid Until(YYYYMMDD):** date on the License page under **Tools > Settings > Licensing**.

Two weeks before your license expires, on your Main Appliance home page, you'll see a red banner with a notification message counting down the days to the expiration date.

## What Uses a License in Device42?

Device42 has a Core license for autodiscovery and offers additional license modules for more discovery and data retrieval capabilities.

The Core license includes the discovery of physical, virtual, and cloud components, IT inventory and asset management, all out-of-the-box integrations, RESTful APIs and webhooks, warranty and SSL certificate management, cable management, password management, and IP address management.

Device42 licensing is based on license units. The units are consumed at different rates by different discovered resources. For example:

- 1 Device = 1 License Unit (1 : 1)
- 10 Containers = 1 License Unit (10 : 1)
- 50 TB Storage = 1 License Unit (50 TB : 1)
- 1 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) = 1 License Unit (1 : 1)
- 10 Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) = 1 License Unit (10 : 1)
- 100 Archived Records = 1 License Unit (100 : 1)

:::note
Device42 has lowered the license cost of the AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage Containers from 1.00 to 0.10 License Units.
:::

The lower portion of the **Tools > Settings > Licensing** page displays the number of purchased licenses and the number of license units consumed by the different discovered components.

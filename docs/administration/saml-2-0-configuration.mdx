Device42 integrates with SAML 2.0 in conjunction with AD or LDAP user synchronizations to provide Single Sign On (SSO) support in Device42. Once users are added to Device42 via Active Directory or LDAP, they will automatically be logged into Device42 when they load the site.

:::note
Since authorization is handled by Device42, the user needs to exist within Device42 before they can log in for single sign on functionality to work.
:::

SAML configuration varies between providers, but we'll provide the steps for configuration with Microsoft ADFS, Okta and Onelogin below as examples. Device42 SSO should also work with **any** SAML2.0 compatible Identity Provider, and has been confirmired working with IDaaS providers Centrify and PingIdentity's PingOne and PingFederate as well.

Should you need further assistance, please contact [Support](mailto:support@device42.com).

## Microsoft ADFS Configuration

Add new relying party trust.

![](/assets/images/SAML-admin_adfs-004.png)

Next screen: Permit all users

Next screen: In claims section (click **Edit claims** on relying party / automatic go to this section after initial setup), add the following claims

The `username` claim:

![ADFS Party Trust](/assets/images/adfs-005.png)

The `nameid` claim:

![ADFS Party Trust](/assets/images/adfs-006.png)

Copy metadata URL from the endpoints.

If you receive a time synchronization error please write this command in PowerShell: 

```bash
Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -TargetIdentifier "" -NotBeforeSkew 5
```

## Azure AD Configuration

1. Navigate to Azure AD in the Azure portal via **Enterprise Applications > New Application > Create your own application**. Give your app a name (the app shown in the screenshots is `Device42SAML`) and select the third option **Integrate any other application...**, then click **Create**.

    ![](/assets/images/image-5.png)

2. Open your newly created enterprise app the select Option 2 **Set up Single sign on**, or select **Single sign-on** under **Manage** in the left-hand toolbar.

    ![](/assets/images/image2.png)

3. Enter `https://<D42-FQDN-or-IP>/saml2_auth/acs/` **in Identifier (Entity ID)** and Reply URL **(Assertion Consumer Service URL)** in Section 1 - Basic SAML Config.

    ![](/assets/images/image3.png)

4. Navigate to the Device42 Appliance Manager and go to **Global Settings > SAML/SSO Settings**. Copy the App Federation Metadata URL in the SAML Signing Certificate section from the enterprise app you created in Azure AD and paste into the **Metadata auto conf url** field in the Device42 Appliance Manager.

    ![](/assets/images/image4.png)

5. While still in the SAML 2.0 settings of the Appliance Manager, enter `username` or other appropriate SAML attribute. Unless you have signed responses configured on your Azure AD provider side, keep **Require signed response** unchecked, otherwise you'll get an unavailable page message. 

    Azure's built-in claims like `emailaddress` may not work with Device42, even though they appear in the Azure interface because the built-in claim uses a namespace URI format. The solution is to create a new claim for `emailaddress` in your Azure AD enterprise app, map the claim to the user attribute, and use the custom claim name in the Device42 SAML **Username field**.

    Save and restart the appliance from the VM console menu. You may wish to complete steps 6 and 7 before saving or restarting so that you can still log in to Device42 and create users with the local admin account you've used so far. 

    ![Enter SAML username](/assets/images/enable-saml-2.0.png)

6. Assign users or groups to the SAML enterprise app you created in Azure AD. These should be users or groups that you want to allow authentication into Device42 via this SAML integration.

7. For any users associated with the enterprise app in Azure AD, create the user in Device42 using the appropriate Azure AD value with a dummy password. The integration does not pull and create users directly from Azure AD, so the users must be created within Device42 prior to any attempt to authenticate via Azure AD.

8. Once the above has been completed, you should be able to login to your Device42 instance with your Azure AD credentials.

## Okta Configuration

In Okta, click the **Admin** button:

![Okta Admin Link](/assets/images/saml-001.png)

Click the **Applications** button.

![Okta Applications Link](/assets/images/saml-002.png)

In the Applications page, find and click the **Add application** button..

![Okta Admin Link](/assets/images/saml-003.png)

Choose **Create new app**.

![Okta Admin Link](/assets/images/saml-004.png)

Select **Web** as the **Platform** and select **SAML 2.0** and the **Sign on method**.

![Okta Admin Link](/assets/images/saml-005.png)

Set your application preferences and click **Next**.

![Okta Admin Link](/assets/images/saml-006.png)

On the next page setup ACS url and field mapping. The Single Sign On URL & Audience URI should be `https://yourdevice42address/saml2_auth/acs/`. The Attribute value should be the same AD or LDAP attribute that your users will log into Device42 with. Note the "Name" given to it as this will be needed in the Device42 Appliance Manager configurations.

![Okta Admin Link](/assets/images/saml-007.png)

Click **Next** and finish setup. Open your application settings, go to the **Sign On** tab and copy the URL from **Identity provider metadata** link. This will be used as the **Metadata auto conf url** in Device42's Appliance Manager.

## OneLogin Configuration

To configure SAML2 integration between OneLogin and Device42, you have to create a `SAML2 connector app` in OneLogin. Then, you will need to add users to the `SAML2 connector app` so they can login via a OneLogin account.

**Creating SAML2 Connector App**

1. Create and log in to your OneLogin account.

2. Create an app connector in OneLogin:

    - Go to **Applications > Applications**.

## Data Reset Tool - Clear All Devices from Device42

If you're looking to wipe your Device42 instance clean, grab the Python script available on [Github](https://www.Github.com/Device42) -- _use it to remove all devices from your Device42 MA._

To use the tool, simply open it in your favorite text editor _\[ours are [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) & [Atom](https://www.Atom.io)\]_, and edit the Device42 URL to point at your instance. Update the username/password fields with credentials for your instance, and save.

You can then run the script on any computer with Python 2.7+ installed.

**Note:** The Device42 reset script does not currently clear subnets from the application, they will need to manually be cleared. WARNING: THIS SCRIPT WILL CLEAR ALL DEVICES FROM DEVICE42 -- [Make a backup](/device42-appliance-manager/setting-up-backup-device42-appliance-manager/) first if you're even a little bit unsure!

You can create Active Directory (AD) settings in Device42 and use them to add AD users as administrators.

First, add your AD settings under **Tools > Settings > Active Directory Settings**. See the [Active Directory and OpenLDAP](active-directory-and-openldap-support.mdx) page for details. 

Next, manually add an administrator user from the Active Directory domain you configured. Navigate to **Tools > Admins & Permissions > Administrators** and click **Create Active Directory Admin**.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/active-directory-and-openldap-support/add-ad-admin-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/active-directory-and-openldap-support/add-ad-admin-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Search for an Active Directory user to add as an administrator. Device42 displays the AD domain associated with the user you searched for before you add them.

[The **Username login Style** option](active-directory-and-openldap-support.mdx#add-new-active-directory-or-openldap-settings) selected when the AD settings were added controls how Device42 formats and recognizes usernames during login (for example, as `Domain\Username` or `username@domain`).

<ThemedImage
    alt="Add Active Directory user as admin"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/active-directory-and-openldap-support/add-ad-admin-user-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/active-directory-and-openldap-support/add-ad-admin-user-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Note that Active Directory credentials are not stored in the Device42 application. You need to enter valid domain user credentials each time you search for a user.

## Configuring the Active Directory User Discovery/sync Job

You can configure an AD Sync Job to pull in AD user data in bulk and/or keep them synced. See [the Active Directory Discovery Job docs page](auto-discovery/active-directory-sync.mdx) to view the AD discovery process.

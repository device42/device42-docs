### What is a Burnt Secret?

A 'burnt secret' is a way to store a Secret (saved credentials) and designate it as un-retrievable. If a Secret is set to **Burnt**, it can never be retrieved after being stored, however, Device42 can utilize a burnt secret for discovery.

If a burnt Secret is forgotten, it **must** be reset and regenerated. Storing the new password as **Burnt** repeats this cycle.

**Do not use burnt secrets if you will need to retrieve a stored password in the future.**

### Store a Burnt Secret

Creating a burnt Secret is very similar to the creation of a normal stored Secret. Head to the **Resources > All Secrets** and click **Create**. 

The **Password Storage** option can be set to **Burnt** (as opposed to the default of **Normal**), which will cause a Secret to be stored non-retrievable:

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/burnt-secret-password-storage/add-burnt-secret-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### View Burnt Secrets

Navigate to the Secrets list page under **Resources > Secrets**. Select the **Password Storage** filter and choose **Burnt** to view only burnt Secrets:

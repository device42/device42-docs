Select _Tools > Settings > Password Security_ and choose a 12-32 characters pass phrase. Important considerations:

- This is used to encrypt all stored passwords.
- It is a one time setup, so please choose your passphrase carefully.
- The longer the passphrase the better.
- If you backup and restore your data to a new device42 appliance, you would need this pass phrase to decrypt (or see) the passwords.
- Save this in a secure location.

You can't add a password without setting this first. If you fail to set a passphrase, you will see the following error message:

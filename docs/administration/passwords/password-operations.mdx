### About Passphrases

Secrets are objects that store credentials and related information saved to Device42, typically for the use of authentication during discovery. 

Before creating your first Secret, you need to set a passphrase to encrypt all stored passwords. You won't be able to create a password without setting this first. If you fail to set a passphrase, you will see the following error message:

![](/assets/images/wpid4211-media_1345899633250.png)

If you [backup](administration/appliance-manager/setting-up-backup-device42-appliance-manager.mdx) and [restore](administration/appliance-manager/device42-restore.mdx) your data to a new Device42 appliance, you will need this passphrase to decrypt (or see) the passwords.

### Create a Passphrase

Navigate to **Tools > Settings > Password Security** and enter a 12-32 character passphrase. The longer the passphrase the better. This is a one time setup, so please choose your passphrase carefully and save it in a safe location.

## Add a New Secret

Navigate to **Resources > Secrets >All Secrets** and click **Create**. 

You'll also have the option to add a new Secret from discovery job page and from wherever credentials are needed.

  }}
/>

Fill in the following fields:

- **Username**: Required. Even if this is an account without a username, assign one for easy identification. This is useful for search as well. 
- **Label**: Optional. This helps to differentiate and search. 
- **Category**: Select a category or add a new one. 
- **\# Days Before Expiration**: Number of days before the password expires. 
- **Use Password**: Selected by default. 
- **Password Storage**: Choose between **Normal** or **Burnt**. See [Burnt Secret Storage](administration/passwords/burnt-secret-password-storage/#what-is-a-burnt-secret.mdx).
- **Password:** Required when **Use Password** is selected. Click the eye icon to display the password. 
- **Key File**: Select an existing key file stored on your machine. 
- **Devices**: Optionally assign devices to a password. This is useful for easy searching and centralizing all device passwords. You can select multiple devices. 
- **Application Components**: Optionally Application Components to a password. This is useful for easy searching and centralizing all application passwords. You can select multiple Application Components. See [Application Components](apps/application-components/index.mdx).
- **Notes**: Searchable free text.
- **Last Password Change**: Provide the date and time when the password was changed.
- **Custom Fields**: Assign custom field values. See [Create a Custom Field for Secrets](administration/custom-key-value-pairs-explained/#create-a-custom-field-for-secrets.mdx).

### Assign Permissions

At least one user or group needs to have permission assigned to view and edit the password (otherwise, no one can edit it). 

If view edit users and view edit groups is left empty, the logged in user is automatically added to view edit users.

- **View Users**: Users who can view the password. 
- **View Groups:** Groups who can view the password. 
- **Use Only Users**: Users who can only use the password. 
- **Use Only Groups**: Groups that can only use the password. 
- **View Edit Users**: Users who can view, edit, and delete the password. 
- **View edit groups**: Groups that can view, edit, and delete the password.

### Generate a Password

When adding a new account and password, you can auto-generate password. Click **Generate Password** at the upper right of the Add Secret page. Click **Use** to insert the generated password or **Generate Other** to get a new password.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-operations/generate-password-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The default case, number, and special character counts can be changed in the **Secrets** section of the **Tools > Settings > Global Settings** page.

  }}
/>

### View Secrets

Navigate to **Resources > Secrets > All Secrets** to display the Secrets list page. You can search for a password by username, label, Application Component, device name, or notes. 

Note the search bar doesn't return matches for passwords, you have to go to the Secrets list page to perform a search for specific passwords (stored in the Secret object).

By default, the password is not displayed; click the blue eye icon to display or re-hide the password. Click the blue copy icon to copy the password to the clipboard.

Click the **Username** to view the Secret, and then click **Edit** to display the Change Password page. Click the **ellipsis icon** to display the password.

  }}
/>

Policy settings include:

- Minimum password length
- Minimum number of uppercase, numeric, and special characters
- Password expiration timing
- User account locking after specified number of invalid login attempts
  :::caution
  Please note that **Lock accounts** is a global setting that applies to all users, including admin superusers. If you enable account locking, ensure that you create a second superuser in case the main admin is locked out.
  :::
- User alerts for password expiration

Select the options you want to enforce and the values for your password rules, and then click **Save**.

### User Login

- A login attempt with an invalid password counts against account lockout.
- If a user enters a valid password after their password has expired, they are prompted to change their password.
- Users are alerted the designated number of days prior to password expiration.
- Users locked out of their account see an alert when they try to login and must contact their administrator to regain account access.

### User Password and Account Status

The **Tools > Admins & Permissions > Administrators** page displays the current password and account status for each user. Administrators can expire a user’s password, exempt a user from password expiration, and unlock a user’s account.

Device42 administrators can define user password policy requirements and expiration settings to increase password strength and improve security. Policy settings include:

- Minimum password length
- Minimum number of uppercase, numeric, and special characters
- Password expiration timing
- User account locking after specified number of invalid login attempts
- User alerts for password expiration

Select the options you want to enforce and the values for your password rules, and then click **Save**.

### User Login

- A login attempt with an invalid password counts against account lockout.
- If a user enters a valid password after their password has expired, they are prompted to change their password.
- Users are alerted the designated number of days prior to password expiration.
- Users locked out of their account see an alert when they try to login and must contact their administrator to regain account access.

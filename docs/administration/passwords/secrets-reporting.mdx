## Create a Secrets Report

Navigate to **Analytics > Reports > Standard Reports** from the menu and click **Create**. Choose **Guided Report**, and under the **Select Object** dropdown menu, select **Secrets**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-reporting/select-object-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Device42 displays your Secrets data in a grid view. 

- Click the **Table Columns** dropdown to view, select, and deselect the default column configuration to fit your needs.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-reporting/table-columns-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Filter the report by additional criteria by clicking **More Filters** and selecting from the available fields, including: **Username**, **Label**, **Expiration Date**, **Last Password Change**, and more.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-reporting/username-contains-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Provide values for your selected filters. For date-related fields, you can specify a date range or define a period of time in the past.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-reporting/last-password-change-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-reporting/last-password-change-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- For text fields, you can enter a matching or partially-matching string to filter the Secrets data by.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/password-reporting/username-filter-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Enter a unique name for the report in order to **Save** it.

### Export and Schedule the Report

Device42 allows you to set a default view-edit group for passwords. Once set the group(s) will be given view-edit privileges by default on all new passwords.

### Setting the Default Group

To set one or more default groups with view-edit privileges to passwords, go to **Tools > Settings > Global Settings**, and then click **Edit**. 

Near the top of the page, you will see a Secrets section with groups listed. You can create a new group, or select from the current groups. To select more than one group, hold `Ctrl` while clicking.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/set-default-password-management-group/global-settings-edit-groups-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/set-default-password-management-group/global-settings-edit-groups-light.png'),
  }}
/>

After selecting your groups, click **Save**. After this, any password created will have the selected groups set with view-edit privileges and these privileges cannot be removed. Any password that was created prior to setting this rule will not be automatically updated, but the view-edit group will be applied if the password is edited.

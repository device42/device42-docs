Device42 allows you to set a default View/Edit group for passwords. Once set the group(s) will be given view/edit privileges by default on all new passwords.

### Setting the Default Group

To set one or more default groups with View/Edit privileges to passwords, go to _Tools > Settings > Global Settings_, and then click **Edit**. Near the top of the page, you will see a Secrets section with groups listed. You can create a new group, or select from the current groups. To select more than one group, hold Control while clicking.

After selecting your groups, click **Save**. After this, any password created will have the selected groups set with view/edit privileges and these privileges cannot be removed. Any password that was created prior to setting this rule will not be automatically updated, but the view/edit group will be applied if the password is edited.

:::caution
Please take note of the following before you proceed with the restore process:

- The Device42 versions of the backup and restore must be identical for the backup-restore scenario to be supported.
- The restore process will delete all current data in the appliance. You can do a [test restore](#test-restore-options) first to verify that the restore works as you expect.
:::

### Active Directory Settings 

Active Directory settings are crucial for logging back in. Otherwise, you can use local accounts to log back in after the restore and add active directory settings later.

If you are doing a restore and have only Active Directory users (no Device42-only users), you will need to manually add the Active Directory Settings prior to the restore.

## Restoring the MA and RC Backup Files

From the [Appliance Manager](/administration/appliance-manager/device42-appliance-manager-login), navigate to **Backup/Restore > Restore**. 
- Select **Main Appliance** or **Remote Collector**. You need separate backup `.enc` files for the Main Appliance and Remote Collector.
- To do the restore, enter the passphrase you used for the backup. If you have forgotten the password encryption phrase, you can create a new backup by clicking **Set Passphrase** on left menu panel, click **Clear Passphrase**, create the new passphrase, and create a new backup.
- Select the **Restore Meta Data** option. If you did not select the **Backup Meta Data** option [when creating the backup](/administration/appliance-manager/setting-up-backup-device42-appliance-manager#run-backup-now), re-enter the following settings and options after restoring the appliance:

  - Passphrases for backups and Password Encryption
  - Language
  - Time
  - SSL/HTTPS
  - Host/hostname information
  - All appliance manager settings (Including back-up schedules)
  - All certificates
- **Browse** to the backup `.enc` file you want to restore.

- You'll see a success message at the bottom of the screen. Contact our [support team]([/contact-support](https://support.device42.com/)) team if you have any issues with restoring a backup.

- Restart the application once the restore is finished by going to **Application > Restart Application**.

## Test Restore Options

If you are doing a test restore, we recommend the following two options:

1. Spin up a new Device42 virtual appliance and restore there. A second instance is useful to have for disaster recovery or business continuity purposes, as described on the [Warm HA Configuration](administration/appliance-manager/warm-ha-setup-failover-and-automated-backups.mdx) page. Your license allows one production and one backup instance.
2. Take a VM snapshot first and then do a test restore.

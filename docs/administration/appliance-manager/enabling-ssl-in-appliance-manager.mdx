Device42 now has the ability to use HTTPS in the Appliance Manager in addition to the existing HTTPS in the main appliance.

To enable this functionality, log in to the Device42 Appliance Manager by clicking the link at the bottom of the main login page, and entering your Device42 credentials. The default name and password for the Appliance Manager is d42admin/default. For details on the URL to use and updating the default password, see [Appliance Manager Login](device42-appliance-manager-login.mdx).

- From the main menu (left panel) of the Appliance Manager, select **Appliance Manager SSL**: 
- Check **Enable HTTPS** to enable SSL and click **Set**. You'll see a success message prompting you to restart the appliance from the VM console.

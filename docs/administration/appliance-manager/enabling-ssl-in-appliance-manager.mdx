# Enabling SSL in Appliance Manager

Device42 now has the ability to use HTTPS in the Appliance Manager in addition to the existing HTTPS in the main appliance.

To enable this functionality, log into the Device42 Appliance Manager by clicking the link at the bottom of the main login page, and entering your Device42 credentials. The default name and password for the Appliance Manager is d42admin/default. ![Appliance Manager Login](/assets/images/2015-12-17-Appliance-Manager-SSL-04.png)

From the main menu on the left side of the Appliance Manager, select "Appliance Manager SSL": ![Appliance Manager SSL](/assets/images/2015-12-17-Appliance-Manager-SSL-06.png)

This will bring you to a screen with the option to enable SSL. ![HTTPS enabled](/assets/images/2015-12-17-Appliance-Manager-SSL-02.png)

Upon doing so, you will see a success message at the bottom, and will need to restart the appliance by logging into the console and selecting option 4. ![Reboot appliance](/assets/images/2015-12-17-Appliance-Manager-SSL-01.png)

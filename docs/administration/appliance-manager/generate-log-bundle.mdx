If you are experiencing issues with discovery, you can generate log bundle and send it to support for further analysis.

1. Edit the discovery job set the debug mode to **Debug On**. For issues unrelated to autodiscovery, you can keep debug mode off and proceed to step three.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Enable debug by editing discovery job settings"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/generate-log-bundle/edit-debug-level-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/generate-log-bundle/edit-debug-level-dark.png'),
    }}
    />    

2. If the issue is discovery related, re-run the failing discovery job now that you've enabled the debug flag.
3. Log in to the Appliance Manager via the main menu, **Tools > Appliance Manager** or follow the [Device42 Appliance Manager login](device42-appliance-manager-login.mdx) directions.
4. Generate the log bundle via the Appliance Manager. Navigate to **Application > Generate Log Bundle** and click **Run**.

5. Upload the generated log file at [upload.device42.com](https://upload.device42.com/).

### Remote Collector Log Bundle

If you were also using the Remote Collector (RC) for the job, please get and upload the RC log using the [same upload link](https://upload.device42.com/) above. 

Navigate to **Discovery > Remote Collectors** and click on the **Logs** link for the corresponding RC under the **Actions** column. Let us know when the file has been uploaded and we'll continue investing the issue.

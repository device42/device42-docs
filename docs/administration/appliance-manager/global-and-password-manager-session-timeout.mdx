The global session timeout in device42 is set to 30 minutes by default and can be changed as discussed below. Password pages have an additional check for inactivity time (for enhanced security) and if user is inactive for a minute, it logs them out of the session.

### Global session timeout

Global session timeout can be set between 1 to 60 minutes as shown above. Once you choose and save optimal value for you, you will need to restart the application to see the new session timeout in effect.

### Password pages inactivity timer

All password pages(list, view, edit etc.) also have an inactivity timer. If there is no mouse or keyboard activity for 1 minute, the user will be logged out of the session.

You can change the password page inactivity timer from main app from Tools > Settings > Password timeout.

The global session timeout is independent and must be changed separately.

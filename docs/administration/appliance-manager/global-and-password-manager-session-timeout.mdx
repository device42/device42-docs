The global session timeout in Device42 is set to 30 minutes by default and can be changed from the [Appliance Manager](device42-appliance-manager-login.mdx).

For enhanced security, pages containing Secrets and credentials have an additional check for inactivity â€“ if user is inactive for 500 seconds (8 minutes), it logs them out of the session. You can change this setting from the Main Appliance.

## Global Session Timeout

You can set timeout values for the Main Appliance and Appliance Manager.

[Log in to the Main Appliance](device42-appliance-manager-login.mdx) and navigate to **Global Settings > Set Inactivity logout time**. 

Set a new value (in minutes) for the session timeout.

Once you choose and save the optimal value(s) for you, you will need to restart the application to see the new session timeout in effect.

## Password Pages Inactivity Timer

All password pages (list, view, and edit pages) also have an inactivity timer. If there is no mouse or keyboard activity for 500 seconds (8 minutes), the user will be logged out of the session.

You can change the password page inactivity timer from the Main Appliance under **Tools > Settings > Global Settings**. 

Set a new **Password Timeout** value (in seconds) under the **Secrets** section.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/global-and-password-manager-session-timeout/global-settings-password-timeout-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Note the appliance global session timeouts are different from the password page inactivity timer and and must be changed separately.

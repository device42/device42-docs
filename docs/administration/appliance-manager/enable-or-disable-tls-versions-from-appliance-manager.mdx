# Disabling or Enabling TLS Versions From the Appliance Manager

Device42 allows you to restrict TLS versions for Appliance Manager Access. The radio buttons shown below control this feature.

:::note
The Appliance Manager now defaults to **Enable TLS v1.2 only**. You can change the TLS settings in the Appliance Manager to **Enable TLS v.1.1 and v1.2** or **Enable All TLS**.
:::

- To apply TLS version restrictions, log in to the Device42 Appliance Manager. See [Device42 Appliance Manager Login](device42-appliance-manager-login.mdx) for more details about accessing and logging in to the Appliance Manager.
- From the main menu on the left side of the Appliance Manager, select **Global Settings** and then **TLS versions for Web Console** or **TLS versions for Appliance Manager**.
- Select the appropriate radio button and click **Submit** to apply your changes.

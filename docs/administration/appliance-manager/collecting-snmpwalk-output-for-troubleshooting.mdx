You can collect SNMP walk output for a network device or PDU right from the GUI. Then, you can download the output and send it to us for further troubleshooting.

From the Appliance Manager, go to **Application > Generate SNMP Output**. 

### Simple SNMP Walk Output

If this is not a new device, select the **No: Simple walk** option.

Add your target switch or other SNMP target device info, click **Submit**, and please be patient as it might take a few minutes. Download the generated file and send it to support.

### MIB Browser-Based Walk

For new devices, select **Yes: MIB browser based walk**. 

- Select your **RC** and enter the required fields: **FQDN or IP Address**, **Community String**, and MIB file upload.

## Alternative SNMP Walk Generation

If there is an issue, the network is not reachable, or you simply prefer using the terminal, you can instead run the following from any machine that has 'snmpwalk' installed:

```
snmpbulkwalk -Cc -ObentU -v2c -c COMMUNITY DEVICE > output_file_name
snmpbulkwalk -ObentU -v 2c -c COMMUNITY DEVICE .1.3.6.1.4.1 >> output_file_name
```

Also, the current setup has a bug for v3, so please use the following for any system using SNMP v3:

```
snmpbulkwalk -Cc -ObentU -v 3 -u user_name -l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A auth_pass DEVICE > output_file_name
snmpbulkwalk -Cc -ObentU -v 3 -u user_name -l authNoPriv -a MD5 -A auth_pass DEVICE .1.3.6.1.4.1 >> output_file_name
```

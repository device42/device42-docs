From the Appliance Manager, you can set a limit on the number of remote agents that can attempt to update at once. This option is intended for administrators who have hundreds of agents and need to prevent those agents from simultaneously attempting to update, possibly causing the Main Appliance to become overloaded.

The default setting for the API limit is 16 concurrent agent updates. You can configure this number to best suit your needs, choosing a value between `8` and `128`.

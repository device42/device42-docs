Here is a brief run-down on setting or changing your time zone in Device42. This is probably one of the first steps you should take so that autodiscovery scheduling and log history work correctly. The virtual appliance takes the clock from the virtual host, so make sure the time is correct on the host. It's also a good idea to set up an NTP time source to ensure the time stays correct.

## Set the Time Zone

In the Device42 main menu, go to **Tools > Settings > Time Settings**.

Here, you can select the correct time zone for your location and click **Apply**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/setting-time-zone-and-ntp/select-time-zone-success-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## OS-Level Time Settings

After you've selected the correct new time zone and received confirmation that it has been applied, go to the Device42 console and restart the Device42 application. When it restarts, the console menu will show the new time zone.

- Use the VM console menu options, **NTP Settings** and **Set Timezone**, to set time at the OS level.

- Select **NTP Settings** from the main menu and enter the IP or FQDN of the NTP server. Toggle on the **Daily sync** option to add the NTP server to the daily scheduled jobs.

- Go back to the main menu and select **Set Timezone** to set the time zone on the OS level. If you don't see your exact location, choose the location closest to you:

- Select **Restart Services** for the new time zone settings to take effect immediately.

- Once completed, you'll be able to see your new time zone at the top of the Device42 console menu.

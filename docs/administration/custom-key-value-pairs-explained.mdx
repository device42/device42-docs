Device42 offers users the ability to define their own fields.

You can add custom fields to buildings, rooms, racks, customers, devices, assets, application components, circuits, and passwords as discussed below. This feature enables you to store any custom attributes you need to store in Device42. You can also display custom fields and filter on custom fields in Reports.

## Adding Custom Fields

Navigate to the custom fields list page under **Tools > Custom Fields** and click on a custom field object type (for example, **Assets** or **Devices**).

<ThemedImage
  alt="Custom fields menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-01-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-01-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }} 
/>

- From the list page for the selected custom field type, you can either edit an existing custom field or click the **Create** button to add a new one.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom fields device list view"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-02-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-02-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Input the name for the custom field and choose its data **Type**. Certain custom field types, when selected, will present more options specific to that field type. The available types are:

  - **Text:** Custom field values are character-based.
  - **Number:** Custom field values are numeric.
  - **Date:** Custom field values are dates.
  - **Related Field:** Custom field values are values of another field (e.g. If rack is chosen, then rack names are possible values).
  - **Yes/No:** Custom field values are either yes or no.
  - **URL:** Custom field values are URLs. 
  - **Picklist:** Custom field value choices as a picklist.
  - **JSON:** Custom field values are JSON.
  - **Markup:** Custom field values are markup.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Create a new custom field"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-03-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-03-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }}
/>

- If you check the **Filterable** box, the list view page for the object type (for example, Devices) will contain the custom field as a filter option. This allows you to filter the list view by the custom field value. The filterable custom field will be available in the **More Filters** dropdown.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Filterable custom fields"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-04-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-04-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- A custom field marked as **Mandatory** must have a value in order to save the device (or other object) record as shown below. Please note that mandatory only applies when editing or adding an object via the UI. This is not enforced via the API or when adding a new device (or other object).

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom field with mandatory field"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-05-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-05-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

## Custom Field Bulk Actions

- Set custom field values in bulk using the **Set Custom Field Value** action available on most list pages from the **Actions** dropdown.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom field bulk actions"
    sources={{ 
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-06-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-06-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Search for the custom field you want to set values for, input the necessary value(s) and, optionally, add a note.   

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom field bulk actions"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-07-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-07-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

## REST APIs for custom values

You can find the documentation for adding Custom Fields to various objects using the API in the [API Documentation](https://api.device42.com). 

For example, to see the API documentation for adding custom fields to Devices, navigate to **Devices > Custom fields**.

## Exago Reports Note

For Exago reports (which are not enabled by default), we've made changes to a couple of custom field data types that may affect existing queries. Custom numeric and date fields are now represented as `DATE` and `BIGINT` instead of `TEXT`, which might affect existing queries. Queries containing `TEXT`-related builtins, like `SUBSTRING`, may fail and need to be updated using the updated data type. Queries with basic operators in the `WHERE` clause, like `=` and `<>`, should all continue without issues.

Device42 offers users the ability to define their own fields.

You can add custom fields to buildings, rooms, racks, customers, devices, assets, application components, circuits, and passwords as discussed below. This feature enables you to store any custom attributes you need to store in Device42. You can also display custom fields and filter on custom fields in Reports.

## Adding Custom Fields

Navigate to the Custom Fields list page under **Tools > Custom Fields** and click on a custom field object type (for example, **Assets** or **Devices**).

<ThemedImage
  alt="Custom fields menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-01-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-01-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }} 
/>

- From the list page for the selected custom field type, you can either edit an existing custom field or click the **Create** button to add a new one.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom fields device list view"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-02-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-02-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Input the name for the custom field and choose its data **Type**. Certain custom field types, when selected, will present more options specific to that field type. The available types are listed below.

  - **Text:** These fields use character-based values.
  - **Number:** These fields use numeric values.
  - **Date:** These fields use calendar date formatting.
  - **Related Field:** These fields use the values of other fields (for example, if **rack** is chosen, then rack names are possible values).
  - **Yes/No:** These fields use yes or no values.
  - **URL:** These fields use URL values.
  - **Picklist:** These fields use values chosen from a picklist.
  - **JSON:** These fields use JSON formatting.
  - **Markup:** These fields use markup formatting.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Create a new custom field"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-03-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-03-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }}
/>

- If you check the **Filterable** box, the list view page for the object type (for example, Devices) will contain the custom field as a filter option, which allows you to filter the list view by the custom field value. You can find the filterable custom field in the **More Filters** dropdown.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Filterable custom fields"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-04-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-04-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- If a custom field is marked as **Mandatory**, the device (or other object) record can only be saved once a custom field value has been entered, as shown below. Please note that the field is only enforced as mandatory when objects are edited or added via the UI. The field is not mandatory when objects are edited or added via the API.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom field with mandatory field"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-05-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-05-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

## Custom Field Bulk Actions

- Set custom field values in bulk using the **Set Custom Field Value** action, which is available on most list pages from the **Actions** dropdown.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom field bulk actions"
    sources={{ 
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-06-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-06-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Search for the custom field you want to set values for and input the necessary value(s). You can also add a note if desired.   

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Custom field bulk actions"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-07-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/custom-fields/custom-fields-07-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

## REST APIs for custom values

You can find the documentation for adding Custom Fields to various objects using the API in the [API Documentation](https://api.device42.com). 

For example, to see the API documentation for adding custom fields to Devices, navigate to **Devices > Custom fields**.

## Exago Reports Note

For Exago reports (which are not enabled by default), we've made changes to a couple of custom field data types that may affect existing queries. Custom numeric and date fields are now represented as `DATE` and `BIGINT` instead of `TEXT`, which might affect existing queries. Queries containing `TEXT`-related builtins, like `SUBSTRING`, may fail and need to be updated using the updated data type. Queries with basic operators in the `WHERE` clause, like `=` and `<>`, should all continue without issues.

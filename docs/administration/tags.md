Tags help with filtering objects and grouping disparate objects. For example, you could define a "Project X" tag and associate that tag with all the devices, IP addresses, etc... that are associated with Project X.

Tags can be placed on most objects in Device42.

Most reports can be filtered based on tags.

### Creating tags

For each tag, you give it a name and a slug (essential a unique resource identifier).

In the example above, 2 devices and 1 IP addresses were "tagged" with tag "nh4th". 
Tags containing spaces should be wrapped in double quotes, for example, "tag space".

An example of tagging a device with 'nh4th' is shown below...

### Merging tags

If you end up with multiple tags that you would like to merge, ie. due to misspelling or duplication, you can do so easily in Device42. To merge two or more tags first browse to the tags page in Device42 in Tools>Tags.

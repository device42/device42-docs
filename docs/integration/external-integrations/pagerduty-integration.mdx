## Integration Walkthrough

### In PagerDuty

**Integrating with a PagerDuty Service**

1. From the **Configuration** menu, select **Services**.
2. There are two ways to add an integration to a service:
    - **If adding the integration to an existing service**: Click the **name** of the service, open the **Integrations** tab, then select the **New Integration** button.
    - **If you are creating a new service for your integration**: Please read the PagerDuty documentation in section [Configuring Services and Integrations](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-configuring-services-and-integrations) and follow the steps outlined in the [Create a New Service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-create-a-new-service) section, selecting **Use our API directly** as the **Integration Type** in step 4. Continue with the **In** **Device42** section (below) once you have finished these steps.
3. Enter an **Integration Name** (e.g., **Device42**\-**External-Alerts**) and select **Use our API directly** from the **Integration Type** menu.
4. Click the **Add Integration** button to save your new integration. You will be redirected to the Integrations tab for your service.
5. An **Integration Key** will be generated on this screen. Keep this key saved in a safe place, as it will be used when you configure the integration with **_Device42_** in the next section.

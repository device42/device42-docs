## Microsoft LAPS (Local Admin Password Solution) Integration

Device42 integrates with and can pull a password from the Microsoft LAPS (Local Admin Password Solution). Microsoft LAPS refers to a method which secures Active Directory member servers by randomly generating each serverâ€™s local admin password, and storing the generated PW as an attribute of that servers AD object in Active Directory. This password can then be looked up on demand via an Active Directory / LDAP query, and is often used to support scripted / automated actions that iterate through lists of AD member servers.

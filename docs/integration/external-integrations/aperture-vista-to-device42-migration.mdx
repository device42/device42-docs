The Aperture VISTA to Device42 migration works in the following manner: Data is exported from the Aperture VISTA application by first creating Device42 custom views in the Aperture SQL Server database. These views are then exported from Aperture VISTA and saved as `.csv` or Excel files which are then easily imported and mapped into Device42's data architecture. 

Aperture views can be downloaded here: [https://www.device42.com/migrations/aperture/](https://www.device42.com/migrations/aperture/).

Device42 then automatically creates building, data center, and rack configurations for all rack mounted devices. With the import completed, Device42’s agentless autodiscovery tool automatically identifies and maps remaining IP-based network devices and intelligent power equipment for ongoing monitoring and management.

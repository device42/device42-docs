Device42 discovery keeps your infrastructure documentation up-to-date, and with the Zendesk connector, your help desk can access IT infrastructure information via support tickets. 

## Benefits of the Device42-Zendesk Integration

With the Device42-Zendesk integration, you'll benefit from the ability to:

- Click links integrated into Zendesk that jump you directly to the relevant IT infrastructure CI details page in Device42.
- Attach any part of your discovered IT infrastructure in Device42, including devices, racks, parts, and PDUs, directly to your Zendesk tickets.
- View details like device type, device service level, and serial numbers stored in Device42 directly within Zendesk.
- Customize Zendesk by adding your discovered Device42 infrastructure items as columns in your Zendesk custom views.

## Set up the Integration

Before creating an External Integration in Device42 and installing the integration plugin in Zendesk, you need to create a Zendesk API Token.

As a prerequisite, ensure your [Device42 Cloud Connector](integration/external-integrations/device42-cloud-connector-overview.mdx) is configured (under **Tools > Integrations > Cloud Services**) to allow communication between Device42 and Zendesk.

### Create a Zendesk API Token

- To begin, open Zendesk and click the **gear icon** on the left sidebar of the Zendesk interface. Then navigate to **Apps and integrations > API configuration** to enable API token access if it's not already enabled.

- Go to **Apps and integrations > API tokens** and generate a new API access token using the **Add API Token** button. 

    ![Zendesk add API token](/assets/images/zendesk-integration/zendesk-add-api-token.png)

- Name the new API token "Device42 Integration", or something similar, and then copy the token value and save it in a safe and retrievable location.

### Add a Device42 External Integration

Next, enable the Zendesk integration from Device42. Head to **Tools > Integrations > External Integrations** and click the **Create** button.

- Under **Type** select **Zendesk**.
- Enter the **URL** of your Zendesk instance.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Configure External Integration"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/d42-external-integration-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/d42-external-integration-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- In the **Token** field, use the **plus icon** and create a new Secret. Enter your Zendesk username followed by `/token` in the **Username** field (for example, `name@company.com/token`). Then paste the Zendesk API token into the **Password** field. 

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Add new Secret"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/add-secret-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/add-secret-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

    :::note
    Per Zendesk instructions, when authenticating with token access, add `/token` to the end of your username.
    :::


- Save the new Zendesk integration and then copy the new **Verification token**, as Device42 generates a new token on saving.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Save new verification token"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/d42-new-token-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/d42-new-token-dark.png'),
    }}
    />
 
 
Now it's time to install the Zendesk add-on.

### Install the Device42 Add-On for Zendesk

To begin installing the Device42-Zendesk integration, head to the [Zendesk marketplace](https://www.zendesk.com/marketplace/apps/). If you are having trouble with the link, you might need to sign in to your Zendesk account if you aren't already signed in. 

- Search for “Device42 Connector” to locate the integration add-on.

    ![Zendesk Marketplace D42 App](/assets/images/zendesk-integration/device42-connector-marketplace.png)

- Click the Zendesk marketplace **Install** button, choose the name of your account from the dropdown, and click **Install** to continue installation. 

    ![Select account](/assets/images/zendesk-integration/select-account.png)

- Name your integration. We used "Device42 connector for Zendesk" in this example. For the **Token** field, provide the **Verification Token** you saved from the Device42 External Integration setup steps above.

    ![Plugin installation settings](/assets/images/zendesk-integration/connector-configure.png)

- Enable role and group restrictions if desired, but we'll leave them disabled for now. Click **Install** to complete the integration installation.

## Use the Zendesk Connector

Once the plugin is installed, you can associate CIs (Configuration Items) from Device42 with tickets. In Device42, head to any Device, Building, Room, or CI of your choice, and find the **Zendesk** section: 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add or link ticket"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/add-link-ticket-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/add-link-ticket-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Click **+ Link to Zendesk ticket** to link an existing ticket by entering the ticket's ID or URL. 
- Click **+ Add New** to add a new ticket:

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Create ticket form"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/create-ticket-window-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/create-ticket-window-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Click **Submit**, and you'll get email confirmation that the ticket was created. You'll now also see your new ticket listed as an attachment: 

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Ticket attached confirmation"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/ticket-attached-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/zendesk-integration/ticket-attached-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

You'll see any tickets you've created in Zendesk with a link to the associated CI in Device42:

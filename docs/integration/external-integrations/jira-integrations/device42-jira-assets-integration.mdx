Integrate your Device42 instance with Atlassian Jira Service Management (JSM) Cloud to benefit from our autodiscovery capabilities and have your latest IT management information available.

:::warning
Please note that [the JSM Assets app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=device42) is the currently supported Device42-Jira integration app. It is available on the Atlassian Marketplace.

Support for the 'external' JSM Assets integration app [ended on December 30, 2024](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/shutdown-notice-update-on-deprecation-of-the-external-assets-platform/81193), as Atlassian has implemented asset capabilities that are 'internal' (native) to its premium Jira platform. 
:::

The instructions below describe the initial setup process of integrating Device42 with your JSM Cloud account.

### Prerequisites

This integration requires that you have:

* admin privileges to a running Device42 virtual appliance 
* a Jira Service Management Cloud Premium or Enterprise account

### Add an External Integration to Device42 

Create an External Integration in Device42 by going to the **Tools > Integrations > External Integration** page. Click the **Create** button on the top left corner to open a form. 

Fill in the URL you chose when creating your Jira account and select **Insight in JSM Cloud** as the **Type**.

Copy the Device42 **Verification Token** from the External Integration.

/>

### Add the Device42 Assets App to Jira

Install the [Device42 for Jira Service Management Assets](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=device42) app from the Atlassian Marketplace.

Next, open the Device42 Insight Connect app and configure it by clicking on the **Settings** tab. In the "Device42 Cloud Connector" field type in `connect.device42.io`. Paste the verification token that you copied from the Device42 external integration into the "Device42 Verification Token" field. Click on the **Save** button.

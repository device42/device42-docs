Integrate your Device42 instance with Atlassian Jira Service Management (JSM) Cloud to benefit from our autodiscovery capabilities and have your latest IT management information available.

:::warning
Please note that the currently supported Device42-Jira integration app is [this JSM Assets app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1229672/device42-for-jira-service-management-assets) available on the Atlassian Marketplace.

Support for the 'external' JSM Assets integration app [ended on December 30, 2024](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/shutdown-notice-update-on-deprecation-of-the-external-assets-platform/81193), as Atlassian has implemented asset capabilities that's 'internal' (native) to its premium Jira platform. 
:::

The instructions below describe the initial setup process of integrating Device42 with your JSM Cloud account.

### Prerequisites

This integration requires that you have:

* admin privileges to a running Device42 virtual appliance 
* a Jira Service Management Cloud Premium or Enterprise account

### Add an External Integration to Device42 

Create a Jira external integration in Device42 by going to the **Tools > Integrations > External Integration** page. Click on the **Add External Integration** button on the top left corner to open a form. 

Fill in the URL you chose when creating your Jira account and select "Insight in JSM Cloud" as the "Type" value. Add the secret you created to the "Verification Token" field and click on the **Save** button at the bottom right of the page. 

Copy the Device42 "Verification Token" from the external integration you just created.

Integrate your Device42 instance with Jira Service Management (JSM) to manage your team's tasks, linking them directly to the impacted assets. 

:::tip
For installation instructions of the [Device42 for JSM **Assets**](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1229672/device42-for-jira-service-management-assets?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) app, see the [JSM Assets integration](integration/external-integrations/jira-integrations/device42-jira-assets-integration.mdx) page.

This version of the integration is for Jira Service Management Cloud only. If you are looking to integrate Device42 with a self-hosted version of Jira software, see [Device42-Jira (self-managed) integration page](device42-jira-integration.md).
:::

## Installation and Configuration

### Integration Prerequisites

To integrate Device42 with JSM Cloud, you need:

* A running Device42 virtual appliance, populated with configuration items (CIs) to sync to Jira. 
* Administrator access to a **Jira Cloud account** to install and configure the [Device42 Jira Service Management app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218369/device42-for-jira-service-management?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).

### Set Up Device42 Cloud Services

Prepare your Device42 instance for cloud service integration by navigating to **Tools > Integrations > Cloud Services**. Fill in the **D42 URL for SaaS apps** field with the hostname for your Device42 instance, and add your **Company Name** and **Email**.

## Integration Usage and Features

### The JSM Interface in Device42 

Once the Device42 for Jira Service Desk app has been installed and configured, you will see a new entry for **Jira - your-Jira-instance-address** (for example, **Jira - https://d42product.atlassian.net**) at the bottom of your Device42 assets pages. You can go to **Resources > Compute > All Devices** and select an asset or search for one from the list of devices.

* Jira issues linked to a given CI will display information about the issue **Reporter**, **Assignee**, and **Status**.

* Under the **Action** column, click on the red **x** to the right of a linked issue to remove that issue from the asset. **Note: This will not delete the issue from Jira.**

<ThemedImage
  alt="JSM interface in Device42"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/jsm-interface-in-d42-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/jsm-interface-in-d42-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can create a new Jira issue or link an existing issue using the control links located at the bottom of the interface. Refer to the [Create a New Jira Issue](#create-a-new-jira-issue-from-device42) or the [Link an Existing Jira Issue](#link-an-existing-jira-issue-from-device42) sections for more information.

### Create a New Jira Issue From Device42

1. Click on **Add Jira Issue** and search for your Jira project name. By default, a Jira project name is the first three letters of the automatically assigned issue keys (for example, `KAN-3`).

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Jira project search"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/create-jira-issue-search-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/create-jira-issue-search-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

2. Choose a Jira issue **Type** from the dropdown menu. 
3. The **Reporter** value is visible but is fixed by the Jira integration configuration process.
4. Fill in the **Assignee**, **Summary**, and **Description** fields, and add any attachments if needed.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Jira project search"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/create-jira-issue-form-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/create-jira-issue-form-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

5. Submit the issue. A confirmation box will display the new Jira issue ID.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Confirmation of issue creation"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/create-jira-issue-confirmation-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/create-jira-issue-confirmation-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

The new issue is now attached to the CI.

### Link an Existing Jira Issue From Device42

1. Click on the **Link to Jira Issue** option and input your Jira project name. Note that the project name is the first three letters of an issue ID by default.

2. Provide the issue ID or a link to the issue you want to link to the CI.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Link existing Jira issue"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/link-existing-jira-issue-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/link-existing-jira-issue-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

3. A confirmation notification will open displaying the linked issue ID. 

### Customizing Which Assets Sync

By default, syncs run daily at 2 AM and only sync "Devices". You can customize the data synced from Device42 by adding new Sync [DOQL queries](reports/device42-doql/index.md), customizing existing queries, or writing your own.

Edit the DOQL selection for sync by going to  **Tools > Integrations > External Integrations** and selecting the JSM external integration.

<ThemedImage
    alt="External integration DOQL sync"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/external-integration-doql-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/external-integration-doql-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

The following data element types can be synced with the default saved DOQLs:

* Application Components
* Buildings
* Customers
* Devices
* End Users
* Parts
* Power Units
* Purchases
* Racks
* Rooms

:::info
When adding or modifying DOQL settings or queries, be sure to reset the last synced time. Default queries are time-constrained, and if not reset, newly selected categories will NOT sync.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jsm-integration/external-integration-reset-last-doql-run-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

### Working With Device42 Assets From Jira

Add a Device42 asset to an existing Jira issue as follows:

1. In the issue **Details** box, click on the link under the name of the [issue type](#configuring-jira) you created when you configured the integration. If multiple assets are already linked, the link will display "View linked assets". If that issue already has one linked Device42 asset, click on the asset name.

    ![D42 Asset](/assets/images/jsm-integration/jira-issue-asset-1-menu.png)

2. Next, click on **+ Link asset** to open a search bar. Start typing the name of the asset you would like to add, and select the asset from the search results. Repeat this step to attach another asset:  

    ![D42 Asset](/assets/images/jsm-integration/jira-issue-asset-2-link-asset.png)

3. Once a record is linked, it will be present on the Jira record. Selecting the record will display its associated information present in Device42. Click on **View in Device42** to be directed to the asset record in your Device42 instance.

    ![D42 Asset info](/assets/images/jsm-integration/jira-issue-asset-3-view-history.png)

4. To unlink an issue from an asset in the Jira Cloud interface, hover your cursor to the right of the name of the CI you want to detach to reveal an ellipsis icon. Click on the ellipsis icon and select **Unlink asset** to confirm.

### JSM Integration Feature Highlights

Integrate Device42 with your Jira Service Management account to do the following: 

* Attach Device42 assets directly to Jira tickets (known as issues).
* Create new Jira tickets and attach existing tickets in the Device42 interface, from any device or asset CI detail view.
* See all Jira issues associated with a particular device or asset CI.
* Filter a set of Device42 assets or devices to display within the custom field of a specific project or custom field set.
* Control which assets are available in Jira Service Management. You can modify the default saved DOQL query (the integration leverages Device42 Object Query Language) or create your own custom DOQL.

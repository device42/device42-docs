## Setting up Device42 from the Azure Migrate Portal

1\. Begin by signing up for an Azure account if you don’t already have one. You’ll have to provide a credit card to verify your identity, and agree to the conditions to continue:

4\. Choose an existing Resource Group, or click the “Create new” link (highlighted) to create a new one. The “Resource Group” name represents the group of machines you’ll be migrating, and can be a name of your choosing, but should be descriptive. Then click“OK.”

For help installing Device42, head over to the Device42 documentation: [https://docs.device42.com](https://docs.device42.com). 1. The [Getting Started with Installation section is a great place to begin! [installation](getstarted/installation/index.md).

2\. Once you’ve installed, you’ll want to begin discovering your environment. See the “Getting started with autodiscovery” section of the documentation here: [getstarted/getting-started-with-auto-discovery.mdx](/getstarted/getting-started-with-auto-discovery.mdx).

3\. When you’ve finished with discovery and assessment, you can export your discovered data back to Microsoft Azure. Instructions on exporting can be found here: [applications/business-applications/building-business-applications-in-device42.md#section-15](apps/business-applications/building-business-applications-in-device42.md#section-15).

## Exporting your Business Apps to Azure for Migration

### Register an Azure Active Directory user

1\. Login to Azure Portal, and create an "App Registration" in Azure Active Directory. You'll need this user to authenticate to Azure when uploading your export. Create a User:

![Create a new Azure User](/assets/images/register_an_application.png)

2\. Create Client Secret and Save the value for Device42.

![Create a Client Secret](/assets/images/certificates_and_secrets.png)

3\. Create a new Migration Project _(if you haven't already; see the prior section on this page)_.

![Search for Azure Migrate](/assets/images/search_azure_migrate.png)

4\. Under Subscriptions > Subscription > Access Control (IAM), click "Add" under Add a role assignment.

5\. Select a "Contributor" role and type the name of the app registration in the "Select" text box (in this case, the name of our app was _dev\_device42_).

6\. Select the app registration and Save. This gives the correct permissions to export data from Device42 to Azure.

## Reviewing your Device42 exports in Azure Migrate

After exporting your Business Applications from Device42 _(__as explained in the prior section)_ to the Azure Migrate portal, log back into the Azure Migrate portal, or refresh if you are already logged in.

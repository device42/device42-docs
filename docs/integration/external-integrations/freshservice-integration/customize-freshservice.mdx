This page covers advanced data mapping customization and XML file editing. 
- For initial setup and installation, see [Setting Up the Device42 Freshservice Integration](index.mdx). 
- For usage and operations, see [Using the Freshservice Integration](use-freshservice-integration.mdx).
:::

If you make an adjustment and use a custom XML file, Device42 will not update the custom XML during updates. 

If you want to incorporate updates, you'll need to do so manually: Download the current XML file, compare it to your customized XML file, and add in the new items as needed.

## Custom Data Mapping

### Download the `mapping.xml` File

- [From the **Settings** tab of the **Configuration** page](index.mdx#find-the-settings-tab), scroll down to the **Schedule Synchronization** section and click the **Data Mapping** button to reveal the custom mapping buttons.

- Click the **Download Default Mapping** button to download the `mapping.xml` file. Customize the mapping between fields in Device42 and Freshservice by downloading, editing, and [reuploading](#reupload-the-mappingxml-file) the `mapping.xml` file. 

    ![Data-mapping buttons](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/data-mapping-buttons-2.png)

### View the Current Mapping

- Explore the mapped fields and their data types by selecting an asset type (for example, **Devices**) from the **Data Mapping Chart**. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the mapping table.

    ![View current mapping](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/view-mappings-2.png)

## The `mapping.xml` File Structure

Open the `mapping.xml` file in a text or code editor to view and edit the data mapping. Version 1.0 of the file has around 6010 lines. There are tasks for syncing data, tasks for syncing the relationships between Device42 CI types (by recreating them between the corresponding Freshservice types), and two cleanup tasks for deleting any assets or asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42.

    ![mapping.xml in VS Code](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/mapping-v1-annotated.png)

 You can customize the data mapping between Device42 and Freshservice by modifying and adding to these tasks. Refer to [The `mapping.xml` File Tasks](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) table below for descriptions of the default mapping tasks, types, and their version requirements. 

For example, the following `<task>` element copies product information from Device42 to Freshservice:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
    ```xml
    <tasks>
        <task enable="true" name="Products" type="product" description="Copy Product info from Device42 to Freshservice" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
            <api>
                <target asset-type="Hardware"/>
                <resource
                    doql="
                    select distinct
                        view_vendor_v1.name as manufacturer,
                    <!-- ... -->
                    "
                />
            </api>
            <mapping key="name" doql-suffix=" where GREATEST(view_hardware_v2.last_changed, view_vendor_v1.last_changed, view_device_v2.last_changed) >'%s'">
                <field resource="name" source-type="string" target="name" target-type="string" max-length="255" escape="true"/>
                <field resource="manufacturer" source-type="string" target="manufacturer" target-type="string"
                   not-null="true" set-space="true" min-length="1" max-length="255"/>
            </mapping>
        </task>
    ```
</details>

Let's take a closer look at the attributes and elements of the `<task>` elements so you can understand what to adapt or emulate to suit your particular case.

### The `<task>` Element Attributes

- `enable`: You can turn off syncing for individual tasks by setting the `enable` attribute to `false`. For example:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Products" type="product" description="Copy Product info from Device42 to Freshservice" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
    ```

    Note that if you turn off a task that has `asset` or `asset_relationship` as its corresponding Freshservice type (for example, devices, business services, and resources in Device42), you'll need to find and remove its corresponding query snippet in the `Delete` cleanup tasks. For an example, see [this answer in the FAQ section](#how-do-i-prevent-a-relationship-between-two-device42-asset-types-from-syncing-to-freshservice).

- `name`: You can edit the task name. Task names appear in the [integration app's **Data Mapping Chart**](#data-mapping-between-device42-and-freshservice).
- `type`: Holds the [Freshservice classification](https://api.freshservice.com/) of the data. The valid types are:

  - `product`
  - `asset`
  - `software`
  - `software_installation`
  - `asset_relationship`
  - `contract`
  - `contract_asset`
  - `component`
  - `deployment`
  - `service`
  - `daemon_set`
  - `stateful_set`

- `description`: You can write and edit a brief task description.
- `d42_min_version` and `d42_max_version`: These attributes specify the minimum and maximum Device42 versions required to run a task. Tasks may have a maximum version, a minimum version, both, or neither. You can generally leave this out when creating new tasks.

### The `<task>` Element Elements

The `<api>` and `<mapping>` elements are nested in each task. Think of the `<api>` element as relating to Device42 data and the `<mapping>` element as relating to the Freshservice fields. 

The `<api>` element contains:

- `<target>`: This holds any additional `asset-type` classifications from Device42 and will be empty in most cases. For example, `Hardware` refers to the Hardware Model under which the details of physical devices are organized.
- `<resource>`: This is the DOQL query used to fetch data from Device42.

The `<mapping>` element contains:

- `key`: This is used to look the item up in Freshservice. It usually has `name` as its value.
- `doql-suffix`: A query condition used to fetch data that has been updated since the last sync. Omitting this value results in a full data sync.

Typically, the first `<field>` represents the Device42 data returned from the query put in a field. The second `<field>` element describes the equivalent field in Freshservice.

- `resource`: The same as the `target` value.
- `source-type`: Not functionally critical; this provides the data type displayed on the [integration app's **Data Mapping Chart**](#data-mapping-between-device42-and-freshservice).
- `target`: The Device42 field to be mapped to Freshservice. The Freshservice convention is to use the display name in snake case, occasionally with the ID of the asset type as a suffix. For example, `memory_max_usage` and `memory_reservation_used`. The sync process determines the ID. Please look up which target field names to use in the [Freshservice API documentation](https://api.freshservice.com/). 
- `escape`: This is used on field elements where `target="name"`. Some characters used in Device42 names aren't supported in Freshservice and need to be substituted. When creating a new task, you can set this to `true`, but disable it if mismatching issues occur.

### Additional Matching Criteria for Updating Existing Items

Some `<task>` elements in `mapping.xml` have a helper `<matching>` element for updating synced data that currently exists in Freshservice but may have slightly different name formats. For example, asset-type syncing tasks include the `<matching>` element to determine which query fields are used to match which asset attributes when trying to find a match. For example:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
    ```xml
    <task enable="true" name="Devices" type="asset" description="Copy Servers from Device42 to Freshservice ..."> 
    <!-- Device42 query -->
        <matching>
            <source-1 
                    device42-id="device42_id" 
                    name="name" 
                    serial-number="serial_no" 
                    uuid="uuid" 
                    item-id="instance_id"
                    mac-address="snmp_device_mac_address"
                    imei-number="imei" 
            />
        </matching>
        <mapping ...>
        <!-- and so on... -->
    ```
</details>

### Reupload the `mapping.xml` File

Save the file and reupload it to Freshservice, using the **Upload Custom Mapping** button [in the **Settings** tab of the **Configuration** page](index.mdx#find-the-settings-tab).

    ![Custom mapping options in the Freshservice UI](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/freshservice-custom-mapping.png)

### The `mapping.xml` File Tasks

Use this table to look up the mapping tasks in the `mapping.xml` file.

Each `<task>` element has the following Freshservice `type`, `description`, and (`d42_min_version` and `d42_max_version`) version attributes.

For a quick look at all the valid Freshservice `types`, see the [The `<task>` Element Attributes](#the-task-element-attributes) section above.

| `description=`                                                        | `type=`                  | `d42_min_version=` | `d42_max_version=` |

### Syncing to Custom Field Names in Freshservice

When creating a custom field in Freshservice that corresponds with a Device42 field, you need to set the target field in the XML file to match Freshservice naming conventions. Verify the correct field names via the Freshservice API endpoint before running the sync. 

Field names in Freshservice are automatically generated according to the following conventions:

- Using lowercase characters
- Replacing spaces with underscores 
- Appending the asset type ID to the end of the field name (this suffix provides a means of verifying the field name, and is visible in the Freshservice interface but not required in the XML file)

For example, the custom field with the `Used By` label in Freshservice is represented internally as `used_by_12345467`, but you'll use `used_by` in the `mapping.xml` file.

Use the following steps to verify that the field name is correct:

1. Navigate to the edit page for the asset type under the Freshservice **Settings** (if you need help locating the asset type's edit page, consult the [Freshservice Assets page](https://support.freshservice.com/support/solutions/articles/164410-different-types-of-assets-configuration-items-in-freshservice)). Copy the asset type ID, which appears in the URL of the edit page.
2. Open your browser to access the API endpoint. Replace `<Freshservice-Instance>` with your Freshservice instance and `<Asset-Type-ID>` with the asset type ID from the URL.
   
```
<Freshservice-Instance>/api/v2/asset_types/<Asset-Type-ID>/fields
```

3. Search the returned JSON for the field label you are interested in to verify the field name.

## Data Mapping FAQs

This section answers some common questions about data mapping between Device42 and Freshservice. We're actively improving the integration and this documentation. Please [contact support](mailto:support@device42.com) if you have technical questions, and use the **Page Feedback** button at the top of this page to leave feedback about the documentation. 

### Syncing a Custom Device42 Field to Freshservice (Overview)

To add a custom field to Freshservice, modify the `mapping.xml` file and reupload it. You'll need to modify the `<task>` that's most closely related to the custom field you want to create.

[Find an existing task](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) with a query related to the field you want to map to Freshservice. For example, if you want to add a custom field about servers, inspect and modify the `Copy Servers from Device42 to Freshservice using DOQL v2` task. Add new `<field>` elements (one for Device42 and one for Freshservice) to the `<mapping>` element of the `<task>`.

Depending on the custom field you want to add, you may have to modify the DOQL query in the `<resource>` element to fetch that data from Device42. If needed, use the InsightsAI chat under **Analytics > InsightsAI** to help you find the tables and fields you need to query.

If you can't find a task related to your custom field, you can create a new `<task>` element in the `mapping.xml` file.

### How Do I Sync a Device42 Custom Field to Freshservice? (Detailed Steps)

1. First, create and add the new custom field in Device42. You can create a custom field for any CI type using either the UI or the API. In this example, we'll use the UI to create a custom field called `Name` in the **Devices** section of **Custom Fields** in the Main Appliance.

   ![Custom fields organized by CI type](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/ci-custom-field-types.png)

   ![Create a Device custom field](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/create-custom-field.png)

2. You should now see the custom field available for all device types. Navigate to the details page for one of your devices and set a value for the custom field. The example below shows the new **Name** field in the **Custom Fields** section for a Server device named `centos-884163.device42.testing`.

   ![Device custom field](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/server-custom-fields.png)

3. Next, add the new custom field to the `mapping.xml` file. Change the DOQL query in the `Copy Servers from Device42 to Freshservice using DOQL v2` task to map the new custom field to Freshservice. (There are normally three types of task with different `d42_min_version` parameters; update the DOQL for each task type, in case you're using older or different versions.)

    **Explanation of the DOQL changes**:

   - The custom field `Name` is added to the `SELECT` statement.
    **Syntax notes**: You need to escape the double quotes (`"`) by using the `&quote;` HTML entity. The greater-than (`>`) and less-than (`<`) symbols also need to be escaped. The equality operator works without special quotes. Please check existing DOQL for examples. 
   - A `LEFT JOIN` is added because all custom fields in Device42 are stored in the `{CI name}_custom_fields` views. For example, the Devices CI is stored in `view_device_custom_fields_flat_v2`.

4. Now it's time to map the custom field to Freshservice. Add a new `<field>` element in the `<mapping>` tag section of the XML file. You'll need to keep Freshservice open and follow the next step to get the exact Freshservice values to use in the new `<field>` element below.

   ![Add a new field element](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/custom-field-map-code.png)

    ```xml
    <!-- Custom Fields -->
    <field resource="cf_name" source-type="string" target="cf_name" target-type="string"
    target-header="Server" not-null="true" set-space="true" min-length="1" max-length="255"/>
    <!-- Custom Fields -->
    ```

   **Explanation of the XML changes**:

   - The `resource=` argument is set to the name of the custom field in Freshservice. The custom field name in this example is `cf_name`, which follows the Freshservice convention of using the display name (label) in snake case for the field name, occasionally with the ID of the asset type as a suffix. (See [Syncing to Custom Field Names in Freshservice](#syncing-to-custom-field-names-in-freshservice) for more details).
   - The `target-header=` argument is set to the name of the CI properties section of the heading name under which the custom field will appear in Freshservice. In this case, `target-header="Server"` refers to the "Server Properties" heading — there's no need to use "Properties", as it's automatically added to every asset type.

5. In the Freshservice **Asset Types & Fields** section, find the asset field to which you are mapping the Device42 custom field. In this case, our example device is of the **Server** type, so we find it under **Hardware > Computer > Server**.
   
    ![Custom field in Freshservice](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/server-freshservice.png)

6. Now, edit the asset type by clicking on the **pencil icon** all the way on the right, as highlighted below in the screenshot of the **Server** asset type. 

    ![Edit the Server asset type](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/fs-pencil-icon.png)

    Set [the 'target' directive](#the-task-element-elements) to the Device42 field you are mapping to Freshservice. 

    ![Label the custom field in the FS UI](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/fs-label-custom-field.png)

7. Finally, run the sync in Freshservice's Device42 integration app. You should end up with the custom field you created and set in Device42:

### How Do I Change an Existing Mapping to Pull From a Different Device42 Field?

In the `<task>` that corresponds with the Device42 field you want to pull from, change the `resource` and `target` attributes of the `<field>` elements in the `<mapping>` element.

Refer to [The `<task>` Element Elements](#the-task-element-elements) section for a description of the `<field>` element attributes.

### How Do I Prevent a Relationship Between Two Device42 Asset Types From Syncing to Freshservice?

You need to modify two `<task>` elements within the `mapping.xml` file.

- In your `mapping.xml` file, [find the `<task>` element](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) that creates the relationship between the asset types you want to disable. Set the `enable` attribute from `true` to `false` to disable the relationship. For example:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Create relationship between cluster and device" type="asset_relationship" description="Create relationship between cluster and device">
    ```

- Remove the corresponding relationship query from the last `<task>` with the attribute `<description="Delete asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42">`, which is nested in the `description="D42 AWS ALB to Freshservice AWS ALB">` `<task>` element.

    ![Task location in VS Code](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/nested-relationship-query-in-vscode.png)
  
    For example, if you want to disable the relationship between clusters and devices, remove the following query snippet from the `<resource doql="` attribute:

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
    ```xml
    <task enable="true" type="asset_relationship" description="Delete asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42">
                <api>
                    <target
                            delete="true"/>
                    <resource
                        doql="
                                <!-- ... other queries -->

                                <!-- remove or comment out this cluster and device relationship query -->

                                select 
                    dc.name as dependent_device_name,
                    format('Device-%s', dc.device_pk) as dependent_device_device42_id,
                                'Member of' as downstream_relationship,
                    dp.name as dependency_device_name,
                    format('Device-%s', dp.device_pk) as dependency_device_device42_id,
                                'Includes' as upstream_relationship
                                from view_devices_in_cluster_v1 dic
                                inner join view_device_v2 dp on dic.parent_device_fk = dp.device_pk
                                inner join view_device_v2 dc on dic.child_device_fk = dc.device_pk
                                where lower(dp.type) = 'cluster'
                            "
                    />
                </api>
    ```
</details>

- Save the file and [reupload it to Freshservice](#reupload-the-mappingxml-file) with the **Upload Custom Mapping** button.

### How Do I Troubleshoot Data Mapping and Syncing Issues?

From Freshservice, go to **Admin**, search for `apps`, and click **Manage Apps**. Find the **Device42 for Freshservice** app, open the **Settings** dropdown, and select **Edit settings**. Under the **Schedule Synchronization**, click the **Sync History** button and click on a row to view details of the errors.

## Examples of Changing the `mapping.xml` File for Specific Use Cases

This section provides specific examples of how to edit the `mapping.xml` file to change the data synced from Device42 to Freshservice.

The line estimates in the examples are based on the default version 1.0 of the `mapping.xml` file and won't match your file exactly if you've customized the sync or used an updated version.

### Example 1: How Can I Stop the Sync From Importing Contracts From Device42 to Freshservice?

[In the `mapping.xml` file](#download-the-mappingxml-file), do a text search for tasks containing the word `contract` in their `description` attribute. You can also search for contract-related tasks in [**The `mapping.xml` File Tasks**](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) table.

Set the `enable` attribute to `false` on those `<task>` elements:

1. Find the task with the description `Copy contract info from Device42 to Freshservice` (around line `2372`):
   
    ![Line 2372](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-4.png)

   Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Copy contract info from Device42 to Freshservice" type="contract" description="Copy contract info from Device42 to Freshservice">
    ``` 

2. Find the `Create association between asset and contract` task (around line `2413`):

    ![Line 2413](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-5.png)

    Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Device Contract Associations" type="contract_asset" description="Create association between asset and contract">
    ```

3. If you want to prevent software licensing from being synced, find the `Copy Software Licensing info from Device42 to Freshservice` task (around line `2437`):

    ![Line 2437](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-6.png)

    Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Software Licensing" type="contract" description="Copy Software Licensing info from Device42 to Freshservice">
    ```

4. Save the file and reupload it to Freshservice using the [**Upload Custom Mapping** button](#reupload-the-mappingxml-file). The **Contracts** option will no longer appear in the **Data Mapping Chart** box

    ![Data Mapping Chart](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/upload-custom-mapping.png)

5. Run a [partial sync](index.mdx#run-the-data-synchronization) to confirm that contract items are no longer being synced, or wait until the scheduled sync runs.

### Example 2: How Do I Prevent Software Imports From Syncing to Freshservice?

[In the `mapping.xml` file](#download-the-mappingxml-file), do a text search for tasks that contain the word `software` in their `description` attribute. You can also search for contract-related tasks in the [**The `mapping.xml` File Tasks**](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) table. 

Set the `enable` attribute to `false` on those `<task>` elements:

1. Find the task with the description `Copy Softwares from Device42 to Freshservice using DOQL` (around line `2087`). 
   
    ![Line 2087](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-1.png)

   Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Software" type="software" description="Copy Softwares from Device42 to Freshservice using DOQL">
    ```

2. There are two `Create Software Install from Software In Use` tasks; one with a `d42_min_version` attribute and one with a `d42_max_version`.  Set the `enable` attribute to `false` on both of them: 
   
    - The first task is around line `2102`:
    
    ![Line 2102](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-2.png)

    Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Software In Use" type="software_installation" description="Create Software Install from Software In Use" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
    ```

    - The second task is around line `2172`:

    ![Line 2172](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-3.png)

    Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Software In Use" type="software_installation" description="Create Software Install from Software In Use" d42_max_version="16.18.02">
    ```

3. Software licensing from Device42 syncs to `contract` in Freshservice. Find and disable the `Copy Software Licensing info from Device42 to Freshservice` task (around line `2437`):

    ![Line 2437](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/example-vscode-6.png)

    Change `enable="true"` to `enable="false"`:

    ```xml
    <task enable="false" name="Software Licensing" type="contract" description="Copy Software Licensing info from Device42 to Freshservice">
    ```

4. Save the file and reupload it to Freshservice with the [**Upload Custom Mapping** button](#reupload-the-mappingxml-file).
5. Run a [partial sync](index.mdx#run-the-data-synchronization) to confirm that software items are no longer being synced, or wait until the scheduled sync runs.

    - Go to **Assets > Software** in the integration app. The page is populated before you disable software imports:

    ![Software before](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/software-freshservice-before-changes.png) 

    - After you've disabled software imports, the page will be empty:
  
    ![Software after](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/software-freshservice-after.png)  

### Example 3: How To Ensure Device42 Correctly Updates the Hardware `asset_state`

By default, Device42 does not update `asset_state` values in Freshservice (in Device42, the field is called `in_service`).

The mapping file includes `<field>` elements with `asset_state` as the target. The `skip-update` attribute is set to `"true"` to prevent the overwriting of values that may trigger Freshservice workflow automations. 

If you want Device42 to update `asset_state` values, set `skip-update` to `"false"`. There are three `<field>` elements to update in version 2.0 of the default `mapping.xml` file:

1. Find the attribute on line 493 (for DOQL v2).

    ![Line 493 of mapping.xml](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/code-skip-update-493.png)

    Change `skip-update` to `"false"`:

    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
    ```xml
    <field resource="in_service" source-type="boolean" target="asset_state" target-type="string"
    target-header="Hardware" skip-update="false">
        <value-mapping default="Retired">
            <item key="true" value="In Use"/>
        </value-mapping>
    </field> 
    ```       
    </details>

2. Find the attribute on line 1302 (also for DOQL v2).

    ![Line 1302 of mapping.xml](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/code-skip-update-1302.png)

    Change `skip-update` to `"false"`:

    <details>
        <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
        ```xml
        <field resource="in_service" source-type="boolean" target="asset_state" target-type="string"
            target-header="Hardware" skip-update="false">
            <value-mapping default="Retired">
                <item key="true" value="In Use"/>
            </value-mapping>
        </field>
        ```       
    </details>

3. Find the attribute on line 1878 (for DOQL v1).

    ![Line 1878 of mapping.xml](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/code-skip-update-1878.png)

    Change `skip-update` to `"false"`:

    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
    ```xml
    <field resource="in_service" source-type="boolean" target="asset_state" target-type="string"
        target-header="Hardware" skip-update="false">
        <value-mapping default="Retired">
            <item key="true" value="In Use"/>
        </value-mapping>
    </field>
    ```
    </details>

The Cloud Services page is used to configure your global external integration settings. Device42 cloud services include product registration and the option to use the [EnrichAI Data](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.mdx) normalization for discovered data. This information was formerly part of the Global Settings page.

See the [Cloud Connector](device42-cloud-connector-overview.mdx) docs page for an explanation of how Device42 manages communication with third-party services.

## Integration Settings

Navigate to **Tools > Cloud Services** and click the **Edit** button to make changes to the **Integration Settings**.

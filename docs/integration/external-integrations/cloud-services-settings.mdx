The Cloud Services page is used to configure your global external integration settings and the option to disable (or enable) the [EnrichAI Data](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.mdx) normalization feature for discovered data. The contents of the Cloud Services page was formerly part of the Global Settings page.

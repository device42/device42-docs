    ## Usage and Features Overview
    
    ### Device42 - Jira Service Desk / Jira Cloud ITSM Integration Interface Overview
    
    Once the Device42 CMDB for Jira Service Desk integration has been installed, you will see a new entry for _"Jira - Your Jira instance name"_ at the bottom of your Device42 Assets pages (e.g. `Jira - https://d42assets.atlassian.net` below):
    
    ![Jira Service Desk tickets on Device42 Asset](/assets/images/Jira-integration-interface-on-D42-Asset-HL.png)
    
    - At the top of the integration 'box', you will see a list of linked Jira issues, the reporter, status, and other useful information about the linked issue.
    - The bottom contains 'control' links - Using these links, you can create a brand new Jira ticket/issue, or can link an existing Jira issue. The red "X" at the right of each linked issue will remove that issue attachment from the Asset _(but does \*not\* delete the issue from Jira)_.
    
    ### Creating or attaching a Jira issue from Device42 UI
    
    1. Choose "Add Jira Issue" - You'll see a "Select Project" Popup; autocomplete field- type project name & click "Select"
    2. You'll now choose a Jira 'issue type' - choose the type ('task'…) and 'reporter' is visible, but fixed by the Jira integration configuration.
    3. Add assignee, summary, description, and any attachments.
    4. Submit the issue; you'll get a box confirming creation with the issue ID
    5. The new issue will now be attached to the CI![Linking an issue](/assets/images/Add_Jira_Issue_Magnified.PNG)
    
    ### Linking an Issue to a Device42 CI
    
    Linking an issue is as simple as choosing “Link to Jira Issue” and providing the Issue ID, which is then linked to the CI.
    
    ### Working with Device42 Assets in Jira Service Desk / Jira Cloud
    
    1. View any linked issue in Jira Service Desk / Jira Cloud, and you'll see "Device42 Objects" on the lower right. These are CI's linked to the issue, and they themselves are links to the Device42 CI they concern: ![assets from d42 on a Jira Service Desk ticket](/assets/images/D42_assets_in_Jira.png)
    2. To link a new issue, open that issue and from the "asset" field, click "Add Asset". Start typing the name of the Asset you would like to add, and it should be match against your partial entry. Click the asset of interest from the 'results', and it's attached. Repeat to attach another: ![Add D42 asset Jira](/assets/images/add_d42_asset_jira.png)
    3. To unlink an issue, from the Jira Service Desk / Jira Cloud interface, click the Red X next to the CI you'd like to detach; choose "Unlink!" to confirm. The issue will no longer be linked.
    
    ### Customizing which assets sync - DOQL & sync settings
    
    Default syncs run daily at 2AM and sync "Devices" only. Users can customize what is synced by adding new Sync DOQL queries, customizing, or writing their own: ![Add new DOQL](/assets/images/Sync_DOQL_queries.png)
    
    **NOTE: _When adding or modifying DOQL settings or queries, be \*\*SURE\*\* to reset the last synced time. Default queries are time-constrained and if not reset, newly selected categories will NOT sync!\*\*\*_** ![Reset last successful DOQL sync](/assets/images/Reset_last_run_success_Time-1.png)
    
    ### Usage / feature highlights
    
    - Attach Device42 Assets directly to Jira Service Desk and/or Jira Cloud issues / tickets
    - View Device42 Asset data natively from Jira Service Desk
    - Create Jira Service Desk tickets and attach existing tickets right from the Device42 interface, from any Device / Asset (CI) details view
    - See all Jira Service Desk issues associated with a particular Device or Asset CI
    - Filter a set of Device42 Assets / Devices to display within the custom field of a specific project and/or custom field set
    - Full control over which assets are available within Jira Service Desk - users may modify the default 'saved DOQL query' _(the integration leverages Device42 Object Query Language)_, or can create their own completely custom DOQL

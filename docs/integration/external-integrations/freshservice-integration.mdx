## Install the Device42 Integration App on Freshservice

The installation process has three steps that are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.

1. In Device42, under **Tools > Cloud Services**, enable the **Cloud Connector** and set the **D42 URL for SaaS apps**. 
2. In Device42, create a new integration under **Tools > External Integrations**.
3. In Freshservice, install and configure the marketplace integration app. 

### 1. Enable the Cloud Connector in Device42

Ensure that cloud services are enabled and configured:

1. Navigate to **Tools > Integrations > Cloud Services**.
2. Enter your externally accessible Device42 IP address or FQDN in the **D42 URL for SaaS apps** field. If you have configured a digital certificate, you can enter the name of the device instead. 
3. Select your **Cloud Connector** location or environment. It's set to **USA** by default.

### 2. Create a Freshservice External Integration in Device42

1. Navigate to **Tools > Integrations > External Integrations** and click **+ Add External Integration**.
   :::caution
   Please **do not** use the **Verification Token** generated when configuring the external integration, as this value will change when you save. Copy the token from the list page view after saving.
   :::
2. Enter the **URL** of your Freshservice instance.
3. Under **Type**, choose **Freshservice**.
4. You can optionally select **Enable Freshworks SSO** to enable single sign-on. We recommend using this feature for a seamless login experience when working with the integration. 

    ![Add external integration](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/add-external-integration.png)

    To enable the single-sign-in feature, ensure that you have an administrator in your Device42 instance with the same email address as your Freshservice agent:
    - Navigate to **Tools > Admin & Permissions > Administrators**. 
    - Click **+ Add Local Admin** if you need to create an admin user with the same associated email address.
    
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Add admin user"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/freshservice-integration/admin-email-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/freshservice-integration/admin-email-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

5. Click **Save** and copy the **Verification Token** from the table on the External Integrations list page.

## Integration App Settings

Use the integration app's configuration page to sync data from Device42 to Freshservice and view and edit the data mapping between Device42 and Freshservice.

From Freshservice, navigate to the Device42 integration app's settings page:

1. Click the **ellipsis icon** and select **Admin**. Search for "apps" using the search bar at the top of the screen to quickly bring up the **Apps** option. 
2. From the **Apps** page, click **Manage Apps**.
3. Under the **Installed Apps** tab, find the **Device42 for Freshservice** app and select **Settings > Edit settings**.
    
    ![Edit settings](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/edit-settings.png)

### Run the Data Synchronization

Data synchronization (sync) brings in new CIs and updates the existing ones within Freshservice. Locate the synced data under **Assets > Inventory** in Freshservice. 

You can schedule a daily sync and run the sync immediately. We recommend that you run a full sync after installing the integration app.

[From the **Configuration** page](#configure-the-integration-in-freshservice), scroll down to the **Schedule Synchronization** section. 

    ![Schedule synchronization](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/schedule-sync.png)

To run the sync immediately, click the **Manual sync** button to reveal the options:

- Select **Run Full Sync** (1) to sync all items from Device42 to Freshservice, regardless of when the items were added or updated in Device42.
- Select **Run Partial Sync** (2) to sync items that have changed in Device42 (either added or updated) since the last successful sync.

To automatically fetch data from Device42 daily, check the **Use Schedule** checkbox and enter a **Sync Time (UTC)** to perform the sync. 

### View Sync History Logs

View the history logs by clicking the **Sync History** button. Viewing synchronization history is useful for debugging issues and seeing the number of devices brought into Freshservice. 

From here, you can view previous synchronizations and currently running ones. You can select a row from the sync history table to view logs (if any) associated with it. The displayed text is limited to 4,000 characters.

:::note
A full sync will be forced during upgrades to get new data from Device42. It will appear as a full upgrade instead of an incremental one under the synchronization history type. This will occur until a successful sync is performed.
:::

## Data Mapping Between Device42 and Freshservice

You can customize the mapping between fields in Device42 and Freshservice by downloading, editing, and reuploading the `mapping.xml` file.

![View current mapping](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/view-mappings.png)

### Download the Mapping File From Freshservice

[From the **Settings** tab of the **Configuration** page](#configure-the-integration-in-freshservice), scroll down to the **Schedule Synchronization** section and click the **Data Mapping** button to reveal the data mapping options.

![Data Mapping buttons](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/mapping.png)

Click the **Download Default Mapping** button and download the `mapping.xml` file. 

### Overview of the `mapping.xml` File Structure

Open the `mapping.xml` file in a text or code editor. 

You'll see multiple `<task>` elements. The tasks either copy data from Device42 to Freshservice or create relationships between Device42 asset types. For example, from Device42, you can bring in device data, bring in software data, and then bring in the device to software relationship.

The important `<task>` attributes for mapping are `enable` and the maximum or minimum version required to run the task. Some tasks don't have a version requirement. Refer to the [task summary table below](#the-mappingxml-file-task-types-and-descriptions) for a descriptions of all the tasks and their version requirements.

Nested in each `<task>` element are:
- `<api>`: Contains the target asset type in Freshservice (for example, `Hardware`) and contains the DOQL query to fetch data from Device42.
- `<mapping>`: Contains `<field>` elements to map the Device42 field to the Freshservice field.

For example, the following `<task>` element copies product information from Device42 to Freshservice:

```xml
    <tasks>
        <task enable="true" name="Products" type="product" description="Copy Product info from Device42 to Freshservice" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
            <api>
                <target asset-type="Hardware"/>
                <resource
                          doql="
                            select distinct
                                view_vendor_v1.name as manufacturer,
                                case WHEN view_device_v2.type = 'Virtual' THEN view_device_v2.type WHEN view_device_v2.type = 'Cluster' THEN view_device_v2.type ELSE coalesce(view_hardware_v2.name, view_device_v2.type) END as name
                                from view_device_v2 left join view_hardware_v2 on view_device_v2.hardware_fk = view_hardware_v2.hardware_pk
                                left join view_vendor_v1 on vendor_pk=vendor_fk
                            "
                        />
            </api>
            <mapping key="name" doql-suffix=" where GREATEST(view_hardware_v2.last_changed, view_vendor_v1.last_changed, view_device_v2.last_changed) >'%s'">
                <field resource="name" source-type="string" target="name" target-type="string" max-length="255" escape="true"/>
                <field resource="manufacturer" source-type="string" target="manufacturer" target-type="string"
                   not-null="true" set-space="true" min-length="1" max-length="255"/>
            </mapping>
        </task>
```

:::tip
Quickly understand the DOQL query in the `<resource>` element: copy the query and paste it into the InsightsAI chat window in Device42 under **Analytics > InsightsAI**.

### The `mapping.xml` File Tasks

Use this table to look up the default mapping tasks in the `mapping.xml` file.

Each `<task>` element has the following `type`, `description`, and version attributes (`d42_min_version` and `d42_max_version`):

| Type                 | Description                                          | Min Version | Max Version |

### How Do I Add a Custom Device42 Field to Freshdesk?


### How Do I Change an Existing Mapping to Pull From a Different Device42 Field?

### How Do I Turn Off Device-to-Device Communication in the Freshdesk Relationship Maps?

You'll need to modify two `<task>` elements within the `mapping.xml` file.

- [Find the `<task>` element](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) in the `mapping.xml` file that creates the relationship between the asset types you want to disable. Set the `enable` attribute from `true` to `false` to disable the relationship. For example:

    ```xml
            <task enable="false" name="Create relationship between cluster and device" type="asset_relationship" description="Create relationship between cluster and device">
    ```

- Remove the corresponding query from the last `<task>` with the attribute `<description="Delete asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42">`. For example, if you want to disable the relationship between clusters and devices, remove the following query from the `<resource doql="` attribute:

    ```xml
    <task enable="true" type="asset_relationship" description="Delete asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42">
                <api>
                    <target
                            delete="true"/>
                    <resource
                            doql="
                                    <!-- ... other queries -->

                                    <!-- remove this part of that query -->
                                    select 
                        dc.name as dependent_device_name,
                        format('Device-%s', dc.device_pk) as dependent_device_device42_id,
                                    'Member of' as downstream_relationship,
                        dp.name as dependency_device_name,
                        format('Device-%s', dp.device_pk) as dependency_device_device42_id,
                                    'Includes' as upstream_relationship
                                    from view_devices_in_cluster_v1 dic
                                    inner join view_device_v2 dp on dic.parent_device_fk = dp.device_pk
                                    inner join view_device_v2 dc on dic.child_device_fk = dc.device_pk
                                    where lower(dp.type) = 'cluster'
                                "
                            />
                </api>
    ```

- Save the file and upload it back to Freshservice with the **Upload Custom Mapping** button [from the **Settings** tab of the **Configuration** page](#configure-the-integration-in-freshservice).

### How Can I Troubleshoot Data Mapping Issues?

### View Mapped and Unmapped Data for Specific Assets

We understand that some fields within Device42 may not easily translate to a field within Freshservice. We’ve added the ability to view these fields to eliminate the need to navigate between applications so that you can view all required fields from one location. To view mapped and unmapped data for a device within Freshservice, follow the steps below.

![](/assets/images/FS_Data_Map_2-700x316.png)

1. Navigate to **Assets > Inventory** from the Freshservice dashboard.
2. On the inventory screen, select the asset imported from Device42 that you want to view mapped and unmapped data.
3. On the right panel of the page, you will see the Device42 application. Click this to expand the application.
4. Once this window is expanded, click the **View Device42 Data** button

![](/assets/images/FS_Data_Map_3.png)

- A window will open, and mapped and unmapped data for the current device will be displayed.

![](/assets/images/FS_Data_Map_4-700x318.png)

- If you close this and select **View Asset in Device42**, you will be redirected to the asset in Device42.

## Install the Device42 Integration App on Freshservice

The installation process has three steps that are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.

1. In Device42, under **Tools > Cloud Services**, enable the **Cloud Connector** and set the **D42 URL for SaaS apps**. 
2. In Device42, create a new integration under **Tools > External Integrations**.
3. In Freshservice, install and configure the marketplace integration app. 

### 1. Enable the Cloud Connector in Device42

Ensure that cloud services are enabled and configured:

1. Navigate to **Tools > Integrations > Cloud Services**.
2. Enter your externally accessible Device42 IP address or FQDN in the **D42 URL for SaaS apps** field. If you have configured a digital certificate, you can enter the name of the device instead. 
3. Select your **Cloud Connector** location or environment. It's set to **USA** by default.

### 2. Create a Freshservice External Integration in Device42

1. Navigate to **Tools > Integrations > External Integrations** and click **+ Add External Integration**.
   :::caution
   Please **do not** use the **Verification Token** generated when configuring the external integration, as this value will change when you save. Copy the token from the list page view after saving.
   :::
2. Enter the **URL** of your Freshservice instance.
3. Under **Type**, choose **Freshservice**.
4. You can optionally select **Enable Freshworks SSO** to enable single sign-on. We recommend using this feature for a seamless login experience when working with the integration. 

    ![Add external integration](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/add-external-integration.png)

    To enable the single-sign-in feature, ensure that you have an administrator in your Device42 instance with the same email address as your Freshservice agent:
    - Navigate to **Tools > Admin & Permissions > Administrators**. 
    - Click **+ Add Local Admin** if you need to create an admin user with the same associated email address.
    
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Add admin user"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/freshservice-integration/admin-email-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/freshservice-integration/admin-email-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

5. Click **Save** and copy the **Verification Token** from the table on the External Integrations list page.

    ![Freshworks sign-in page](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/freshworks-sign-in.png)  

## Integration App Settings

Use the integration app's configuration page to sync data from Device42 to Freshservice and view and edit the data mapping between Device42 and Freshservice.

From Freshservice, navigate to the Device42 integration app's settings page:

1. Click the **ellipsis icon** and select **Admin**. Search for "apps" using the search bar at the top of the screen to quickly bring up the **Apps** option. 
2. From the **Apps** page, click **Manage Apps**.
3. Under the **Installed Apps** tab, find the **Device42 for Freshservice** app and select **Settings > Edit settings**.
    
    ![Edit settings](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/edit-settings.png)

### Run the Data Synchronization

Data synchronization (sync) brings in new CIs and updates the existing ones within Freshservice. Locate the synced data under **Assets > Inventory** in Freshservice. 

You can schedule a daily sync and run the sync immediately. We recommend that you run a full sync after installing the integration app.

[From the **Configuration** page](#configure-the-integration-in-freshservice), scroll down to the **Schedule Synchronization** section. 

    ![Schedule synchronization](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/schedule-sync.png)

To run the sync immediately, click the **Manual sync** button to reveal the options:

- Select **Run Full Sync** (1) to sync all items from Device42 to Freshservice, regardless of when the items were added or updated in Device42.
- Select **Run Partial Sync** (2) to sync items that have changed in Device42 (either added or updated) since the last successful sync.

To automatically fetch data from Device42 daily, check the **Use Schedule** checkbox and enter a **Sync Time (UTC)** to perform the sync. 

### View Sync History Logs

From Freshservice, go to **Admin** and search for "apps" and click **Manage Apps**. Find the **Device42 for Freshservice** app and under the **Settings** dropdown, select **Edit settings**. 

The synchronization history is useful for debugging issues and seeing the number of devices brought into Freshservice. You can view the previous and currently running syncs. 

Select a row from the sync history table to view the logs (if any) associated with it. The displayed text is limited to 4,000 characters.

    ![](/assets/images/WEB-755_FS-view-sync-history.png)

Scroll down to view error messages and other details.

To download full logs, use the **Download Full Log** button located at the lower-left corner of the text area.

    ![](/assets/images/WEB-755_FS-view-sync-history-2.png)

:::note
A full sync will be forced during upgrades to get new data from Device42. It will appear as a full upgrade instead of an incremental one under the synchronization history type. This will occur until a successful sync is performed.
:::

## Data Mapping Between Device42 and Freshservice

[From the **Settings** tab of the **Configuration** page](#configure-the-integration-in-freshservice), scroll down to the **Schedule Synchronization** section and click the **Data Mapping** button to reveal the data-mapping buttons.

![Data-mapping buttons](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/mapping.png)

- View the currently mapped fields and their data types by clicking the **Data Mapping** button under the **Schedule Synchronization** section to reveal the **Data Mapping Chart** of the integration app's settings page. 

    ![View current mapping](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/view-mappings.png)

- Customize the mapping between fields in Device42 and Freshservice by downloading, editing, and reuploading the `mapping.xml` file. Click the **Download Default Mapping** button and download the `mapping.xml` file. Open the file in a text or code editor to view and edit the data mapping.

## The `mapping.xml` File Structure

There are multiple `<task>` elements. You can modify and add to these tasks to customize the data mapping between Device42 and Freshservice. Refer to [The `mapping.xml` File Tasks table below](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) for descriptions of the default mapping tasks, types, and their version requirements. 

For example, The following `<task>` element copies product information from Device42 to Freshservice:

```xml
    <tasks>
        <task enable="true" name="Products" type="product" description="Copy Product info from Device42 to Freshservice" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
            <api>
                <target asset-type="Hardware"/>
                <resource
                          doql="
                            select distinct
                                view_vendor_v1.name as manufacturer,
                            <!-- ... -->
                            "
                        />
            </api>
            <mapping key="name" doql-suffix=" where GREATEST(view_hardware_v2.last_changed, view_vendor_v1.last_changed, view_device_v2.last_changed) >'%s'">
                <field resource="name" source-type="string" target="name" target-type="string" max-length="255" escape="true"/>
                <field resource="manufacturer" source-type="string" target="manufacturer" target-type="string"
                   not-null="true" set-space="true" min-length="1" max-length="255"/>
            </mapping>
        </task>
```

There are tasks that copy data from Device42 to Freshservice, create relationships between Device42 assets, and delete assets or relationships from Freshservice if they don't exist in Device42. For example, there are tasks to bring in device data, bring in software data, and a task to create the device to software relationship from Device42 in Freshservice. 

### The `<task>` Element Attributes

- `enable`: Turn off syncing for individual tasks by setting the `enable` attribute to `false`. For example:

    ```xml
            <task enable="false" name="Products" type="product" description="Copy Product info from Device42 to Freshservice" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
    ```

- `name` : The task name can be edited and appears in the data mapping table of the integration app.
- `type` : A Freshservice classification of the data. The valid types are: 
  - `product`
  - `asset`
  - `software`
  - `software_installation`
  - `asset_relationship`
  - `contract`
  - `contract_asset`
  - `component`
  - `deployment`
  - `service`
  - `daemon_set`
  - `stateful_set`
- `description` : An editable brief description.
- The `d42_min_version` and `d42_max_version` attributes specifies the minimum and maximum Device42 versions required to run the task. Tasks may have a maximum or minimum version, both or neither. You can generally leave this out when creating new tasks.

### The `<task>` Element Elements

The `<api>` and `<mapping>` elements are nested in each task. The `<api>` element relates to Device42 data and the `<mapping>` element relates to Freshservice data. Refer to the [Freshservice API documentation](https://api.freshservice.com/) for details.

The `<api>` element contains:
- `<target>` : Holds any additional `asset-type` classifications from Device42 and will be empty in most cases. For example, `Hardware` refers to the Hardware Model that details of physical devices are organized under.
- `<resource>` : The DOQL query used fetch data from Device42.

The `<mapping>` element contains:
- `key`: Used to look up the item in Freshservice. Usually has `name` as the value.
- `doql-suffix` : A query condition to fetch data that's been updated since the last sync. Leaving out this value results in a full data sync.
 
Typically, the first `<field>` represents the Device42 data returned from the query put in a field. The second element describes the equivalent field in Freshservice.
  - `resource` : Is the same as the `target` value.
  - `source-type` : Not functionally critical. Used to provide the data type that's displayed in the integration app's data mapping table.
  - `target` : The field to map from Device42 to Freshservice. The Freshservice convention is to use display name in snake case with occasionally the ID of the asset type as a suffix. For example `memory_max_usage` and `memory_reservation_used`. The sync process can figure out the ID. Please look up the target field names to use in the [Freshservice API documentation](https://api.freshservice.com/). 
  - `escape` : Used on `target="name"` fields. Some characters used in Device42 aren't supported in Freshservice and need to be substituted. When creating a new task, you can set this to `true` but disable it if mismatching issues occur.

### Additional Matching Logic for Updating Existing Items

Some `<task>` elements in `mapping.xml` have a helper `<matching>` element to update synched data that exist in Freshservice now, but may have slightly different name formats. For example, asset-type syncing tasks include the `<matching>` element to determine which fields from the query are used to match to which attributes on the asset to try finding a match. For example:

```xml
        <task enable="true" name="Devices" type="asset" description="Copy Servers from Device42 to Freshservice ..."> 
        <!-- Device42 query -->
            <matching>
                <source-1 
                     device42-id="device42_id" 
                     name="name" 
                     serial-number="serial_no" 
                     uuid="uuid" 
                     item-id="instance_id"
                     mac-address="snmp_device_mac_address"
                     imei-number="imei" 
                />
            </matching>
            <mapping ...>
            <!-- and so on... -->
```            

### The `mapping.xml` File Tasks

Use this table to look up the mapping tasks in the `mapping.xml` file.

Each `<task>` element has the following `type`, `description`, and version attributes (`d42_min_version` and `d42_max_version`):

| Description                                                        | Type                  | d42_min_version | d42_max_version |

## Data Mapping FAQs

This section answers some common questions about data mapping between Device42 and Freshservice. We're actively working on improving the integration and this documentation. If you have any questions please [contact support](support@device42.com). 

### How Do I Add a Custom Device42 Field to Freshdesk?

To add a custom field to Freshservice, modify the `mapping.xml` file and reupload it. You'll need to modify or create a new `<task>`.

[Find an existing task](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) with a query related to the field you want to map to Freshservice. For example, if you want to add a custom field regarding services, modify the "Copy Servers from Device42 to Freshservice using DOQL v2" task. Add new `<field>` elements (one for Device42 and one for Freshservice) to the `<mapping>` element of the `<task>`.

Depending on the custom field you want to add, you may have to modify the DOQL query in the `<resource>` element to fetch that data from Device42. Use the InsightsAI chat under **Analytics > InsightsAI** to help find the tables and fields you need to query.

### How Do I Change an Existing Mapping to Pull From a Different Device42 Field?

Change the `resource` and `target` attributes of the `<field>` element in the `<mapping>` element of the `<task>` that corresponds to the Device42 field you want to map to Freshservice. 

Refer to [The `<task>` Element Elements](#the-task-element-elements) section for a description of the `<field>` element attributes.

### How Do I Turn Off Device-to-Device Communication in the Freshdesk Relationship Maps?

You'll need to modify two `<task>` elements within the `mapping.xml` file.

- [Find the `<task>` element](#the-mappingxml-file-tasks) in the `mapping.xml` file that creates the relationship between the asset types you want to disable. Set the `enable` attribute from `true` to `false` to disable the relationship. For example:

    ```xml
            <task enable="false" name="Create relationship between cluster and device" type="asset_relationship" description="Create relationship between cluster and device">
    ```

- Remove the corresponding relationship query from the last `<task>` with the attribute `<description="Delete asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42">` that's nested in the `description="D42 AWS ALB to Freshservice AWS ALB">` `<task>` element.

    ![Task location in VS Code](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/nested-relationship-query-in-vscode.png)
  
    For example, if you want to disable the relationship between clusters and devices, remove the following query snippet from the `<resource doql="` attribute:

    ```xml
    <task enable="true" type="asset_relationship" description="Delete asset relationships from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42">
                <api>
                    <target
                            delete="true"/>
                    <resource
                            doql="
                                    <!-- ... other queries -->

                                    <!-- remove or comment out this cluster and device relationship query -->

                                    select 
                        dc.name as dependent_device_name,
                        format('Device-%s', dc.device_pk) as dependent_device_device42_id,
                                    'Member of' as downstream_relationship,
                        dp.name as dependency_device_name,
                        format('Device-%s', dp.device_pk) as dependency_device_device42_id,
                                    'Includes' as upstream_relationship
                                    from view_devices_in_cluster_v1 dic
                                    inner join view_device_v2 dp on dic.parent_device_fk = dp.device_pk
                                    inner join view_device_v2 dc on dic.child_device_fk = dc.device_pk
                                    where lower(dp.type) = 'cluster'
                                "
                            />
                </api>
    ```

- Save the file and upload it back to Freshservice with the **Upload Custom Mapping** button [from the **Settings** tab of the **Configuration** page](#configure-the-integration-in-freshservice).

    ![Custom mapping options in the Freshservice UI](/assets/images/freshservice-integration/freshservice-custom-mapping.png)

### How Do I Troubleshoot Data Mapping and Syncing Issues?

From Freshservice, go to **Admin** and search for "apps" and click **Manage Apps**. Find the **Device42 for Freshservice** app and under the **Settings** dropdown, select **Edit settings**. Under the **Schedule Synchronization**, click the **Sync History** button.

## View Mapped and Unmapped Data for Specific Assets

We understand that some fields within Device42 may not easily translate to a field within Freshservice. We’ve added the ability to view these fields to eliminate the need to navigate between applications so that you can view all required fields from one location. To view mapped and unmapped data for a device within Freshservice, follow the steps below.

![](/assets/images/FS_Data_Map_2-700x316.png)

1. Navigate to **Assets > Inventory** from the Freshservice dashboard.
2. On the inventory screen, select the asset imported from Device42 that you want to view mapped and unmapped data.
3. On the right panel of the page, you will see the Device42 application. Click this to expand the application.
4. Once this window is expanded, click the **View Device42 Data** button

![](/assets/images/FS_Data_Map_3.png)

- A window will open, and mapped and unmapped data for the current device will be displayed.

![](/assets/images/FS_Data_Map_4-700x318.png)

- If you close this and select **View Asset in Device42**, you will be redirected to the asset in Device42.

# Delinea Secret Server Integration

Each Device42 Autodiscovery job is configured to use one (or more) sets of system credentials. If you already use Delinea Secret Server to manage passwords and other secrets or simply don't want to use Device42 for this purpose, the Device42 Delinea Secret Server integration allows Device42 to securely store and retrieve these credentials externally as your primary secret management solution.

Delinea Secret Server offers useful features such as automatic password rotation, which can be configured to rotate secrets per your specific corporate policies and industry guidelines.

Please note that passwords retrieved from Delinea Secret Server are not viewable in Device42.

## Configuring Delinea Secret Server

### Pre-requisites

For the Delinea Secret Server integration to work, you will need to create a user account in Delinea Secret Server with the **View Secret** permission. 

This user should also have view access to the desired folder(s) you would like Secrets retrieved from.

While you can use any user account, it is _strongly recommended_ that you use a dedicated application account for Device42. Application accounts are restricted from logging into the UI and can only be used via the API. 

## Configuring Device42

- Select **Tools > Integrations > Delinea Secret Server** from the Device42 menu.

- The **Test Settings** button attempts to validate the supplied configuration settings by retrieving a token from Delinea Secret server. If a token is successfully retrieved, a message stating "Delinea Secret Server Settings Valid" should appear in the top right corner. (Example Success Response Below)

- If you run into configuration errors related to SSL errors, you may need to disable SSL Verification within the Delinea Secret Server configuration page before trying again.

## Using the Device42 Delinea Secret Server Integration for Discovery

To create a new password object using Delinea Secret Server, simply select Delinea Secret Server from the Password Storage drop-down menu:

**Note:** By default, both usernames and passwords are retrieved from Delinea Secret Server by looking up the secret using either **Secret Name** or **Secret ID**, depending on which was selected in the configuration. Regardless of which option is selected, the value used to do the lookup is assumed to be stored in the **Label** field of the related Secret in Device42. If there is no value for **Label** then the value is taken from the **Username** field instead. Usernames and passwords are parsed from the Secret returned by Delinea Secret Server using the slugs "username" and "password" respectively. You may also override the default slugs used by utilizing **Password Custom fields** named **username_slug** and **password_slug**.

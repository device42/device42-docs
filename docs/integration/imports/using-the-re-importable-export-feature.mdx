### Example: renaming multiple devices

The re-importable export option can be used to make bulk changes to devices. In this example, we will use this feature to rename multiple devices.

Select the devices you want to rename from any device list view, like the one located under **Resources > Compute > All Devices**.

From the **Actions** dropdown menu, choose the **Export selected items** option.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device actions menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/device-export-selected-items-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/device-export-selected-items-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Choose the **Re-importable Export** option and click **Export**. Note that ss of Device42 19.06, the re-importable export feature will generate a spreadsheet in a new browser tab for each 1,000,000 records generated.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Export type options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/select-export-type-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/select-export-type-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Download the spreadsheet and change the device names. If you're using a naming convention that includes numbers, you can allow Excel to auto-fill the device names by typing in the first two names, selecting the cells, and dragging the selection down the column.

Back in Device42, go to **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)** to upload the spreadsheet and then click **Import**.

When the import is complete, you will see the confirmation, "The following lines from worksheet Current were added or updated successfully".

<ThemedImage
  alt="Export type options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/import-xls-successfully-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/import-xls-successfully-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

To confirm the success of the bulk device renaming, search for the new device names from the device list page search bar.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device list page"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/updated-device-names-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/re-importable-export-feature/updated-device-names-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Renaming devices is just one example of how the **Re-importable Export** feature can be used. For example, the re-importable export sheet includes almost 30 device parameters that can be edited and imported back into the system.

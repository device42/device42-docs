Use the spreadsheet imports and export functionality to modify data, add data to Device42, and export current data.

### Overview

The spreadsheet import functionality is located under **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)**.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/menu-location-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/menu-location-dark.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: '70%' }} 
/>

### Importing Data

To load a set of data, first choose a category on the left and click **Download Sample Excel File**. You'll add your data to the sample spreadsheet and import it.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Sample spreadsheet links"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/download-sample-excel-file-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/download-sample-excel-file-dark.png"),
  }}
/>

Below is the sample spreadsheet for the **Buildings - Create/Update Buildings** category.
- The first three rows should not be modified. It consists of the API endpoint, request method, and column headings. 
- The fourth (and sometimes fifth) row contains sample data. Delete the sample data and add the data to import to rows four and up.
- Save the .xls or .xlsx file.

Now upload the file. Head back to the Import/Export (xls) page, browse to add the modified sample spreadsheet, and click **Import**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Browse to file"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/upload-spreadsheet-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/upload-spreadsheet-dark.png"),
  }}
/>

Below the **Browse** button, you'll see a message listing all the records that were added or updated successfully. If any records were rejected, you'll see a reason for each rejection.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Upload success message"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/success-message-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/success-message-dark.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: '70%' }} 
/>

### Exporting Data

Click on the **Download Current Data** link to download a spreadsheet of the current data for the chosen category. This is a simple way to export your data.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Download Current Data links"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/current-data-link-light.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("/assets/images/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports/current-data-link-dark.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
/>

For example, the spreadsheet below shows exported data for the **Buildings - Create/Update Buildings** category.

### Modifying Data

This same functionality can be used to modify your data. Simply download the current data, modify the data in the spreadsheet, and import by clicking the **Browse** and **Import** buttons as described above.

If a category has the **Create** or **Add** options visible to its left and not **Modify** or **Update**, then the records in the imported spreadsheet will be added. So, if you **Download Current Data** and re-import it, you will get duplicates. 

To prevent duplicate records, download and modify the data in the spreadsheet and then delete the existing records before you do the re-import step. Find the list view for the _primary object_ of your category of interest to bulk delete the existing records. For example, go to the racks list view for the **Create Racks** category.

### Exporting Passwords

By default, the password export does not export the actual passwords even for users with the necessary permissions to view passwords. Go to **Tools > Settings > Password Security** to change the default setting. Password exports will then contain the literal string passwords for users with the correct permissions.

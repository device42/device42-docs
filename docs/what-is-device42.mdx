Device42’s powerful DCIM features streamline data-center modeling with intuitive drag-and-drop editors for buildings, rooms, racks, and comprehensive cable management.

### IP Address Management

Our built-in IP Address Management (IPAM) centralizes control of your IT infrastructure’s IP address space, providing unified visibility and management for IP tracking, assignments, and other critical functions. This ensures improved efficiency, enhanced oversight, and streamlined compliance across your network.

### Insight+ and InsightsAI

Insights+ provides out-of-the-box reports and dashboards, plus the ability to harness InsightsAI, a chat-style interface, for creating custom reports and dashboards by generating SQL code or retrieving precise answers instantly.

### EnrichAI®

EnrichAI uses artificial intelligence and third-party data to add to and improve your already discovered IT data, across vendors, operating systems, and software names, end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-support (EOS) dates, and other data.

### Warranty and SSL Certificate Management

Discover, track, and manage warranty information and SSL certificates across your IT infrastructure.

### Storage Discovery

Storage discovery offers agentless, vendor-neutral visibility into leading storage vendors like EMC, NetApp, Pure Storage, Hitachi, IBM, and more. 

Device42 gathers and normalizes performance, configuration, and capacity data across storage arrays, servers, switches, and everything from physical spindles to virtual machine file systems.

### DCIM Thermal and Power Management

The Power and Thermal Monitoring module tracks power and thermal metrics from supported SNMP-enabled devices, including PDUs, UPSs, and CRAC units. Access detailed device insights directly through the Room Layout View for streamlined monitoring.

### Resource Utilization and Cloud Recommendation Engine

Resource Utilization (RU) gathers statistical data on a machine’s disk, network I/O, CPU, and memory use over time. This data is used by Device42’s Cloud Recommendation Engine (CRE) to provide the exact details needed to plan your next cloud migration. The CRE compares costs between different cloud service providers (CSPs) to rightsize your next cloud deployment.

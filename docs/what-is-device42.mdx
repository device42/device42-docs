### [Deep and Wide Infrastructure Discovery](auto-discovery/index.mdx)

Gain visibility into your IT infrastructure with agentless, automatic discovery of your entire IT infrastructure.

Discover physical servers, VMs, network devices, containers, end-user devices, storage arrays, and more — along with their critical relationships - across on-premises, virtual, and cloud environments.

### [Built-In CMDB](auto-discovery/resources/index.mdx)

Centralize your IT data with our powerful Configuration Management Database (CMDB), which holds the most accurate and up-to-date Configuration Item (CI) data.

Device42 maps and visualizes interdependencies, providing unmatched clarity with automated enrichment.

### [IT Inventory and Asset Management](infrastructure-management/index.mdx)

Device42 delivers robust IT asset management (ITAM) documentation for all infrastructure deployments. Its powerful tools ensure that IT teams have instant access to complete, accurate, and up-to-date inventories of their entire IT environments.

### [IP Address Management](infrastructure-management/ipam/ip-addresses.mdx)

Our built-in IP Address Management (IPAM) centralizes control of your IT infrastructure's IP address space, providing unified visibility and management for IP tracking, assignments, and other critical functions. This ensures improved efficiency, enhanced oversight, and streamlined compliance across your network.

### [Data Center Infrastructure Management](infrastructure-management/buildings-rooms-and-racks/buildings-and-rooms.mdx)

Leverage advanced data center infrastructure management (DCIM) and visualization tools to access dynamic, accurate diagrams of your IT environment.

Device42's powerful DCIM features streamline data-center modeling with intuitive drag-and-drop editors for buildings, rooms, racks, and comprehensive cable management.

### [Insights+](reports/reports/insights-plus.mdx) and [InsightsAI](reports/device42-doql/insightsai.mdx)

Insights+ provides out-of-the-box reports and dashboards, plus the ability to harness InsightsAI, a [chat-style interface](reports/device42-doql/insightsai.mdx), for creating custom reports and dashboards by generating SQL code or retrieving precise answers instantly.

### [EnrichAI®](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.mdx)

EnrichAI uses artificial intelligence and third-party data to add to and improve your already discovered IT data, across vendors, operating systems, and software names, end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-support (EOS) dates, and other data.

### [Warranty](auto-discovery/warranty-autodiscovery.mdx) and [SSL Certificate Management](/auto-discovery/certificate-auto-discovery#add-ssl-certificate-discovery-job.mdx)

Discover, track, and manage warranty information and SSL certificates across your IT infrastructure.

## More Device42 Modules

Choose one or more additional modules to meet your needs:

### [Application Dependency Mapping ADM](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/)

ADM is a powerful Advanced ITAM module that provides crucial visibility into how your IT assets interconnect, especially focusing on application relationships. See the intricate web of dependencies that power your business services.

ADM is based on Service-to-Service communications, with information collected via Netstat, which enables Device42 to build relationships between your
servers over time.

### [Business Service Mapping](/apps/business-services/index.mdx)

Business service mapping automatically uncovers application and service dependencies across your network, delivering unmatched insights.

Device42 seamlessly maps communications between applications, services, and hybrid cloud or on-premise environments, giving you a complete view of your IT environment.

### [Resource Utilization and Cloud Recommendation Engine](auto-discovery/resource-utilization-overview.mdx)

Resource Utilization (RU) gathers statistical data on a machine's disk, network I/O, CPU, and memory use over time. This data is used by Device42's Cloud Recommendation Engine (CRE) to provide the exact details needed to plan your next cloud migration. The CRE compares costs between different cloud service providers (CSPs) to rightsize your next cloud deployment.

### [Software License Management](infrastructure-management/software/software-license-management.mdx)

Organizations can create and maintain a comprehensive, accurate profile of the software deployed on Windows and Linux machines across their entire IT estates — from the server to desktop level.

### [Storage Discovery](auto-discovery/storage-arrays-autodiscovery/index.mdx)

Storage discovery offers agentless, vendor-neutral visibility into leading storage vendors like EMC, NetApp, Pure Storage, Hitachi, IBM, and more.

Device42 gathers and normalizes performance, configuration, and capacity data across storage arrays, servers, switches, and everything from physical spindles to virtual machine file systems.

### [Netflow](/auto-discovery/netflow-collector/)

Netflow works hand-in-hand with Device42's ADM module to provide crucial additional connection information from network devices to your business applications. Capture ephemeral connections that might not be consistently identified through ADM's regular sampling intervals.

Our Netflow module augments data gathered by Device42's other auto-discovery methods, such as
SNMP, WMI or WinRM for Windows, and SSH for Linux.

### [DCIM Thermal and Power Management](infrastructure-management/power-and-environmental-monitoring/power-monitoring-and-control.mdx)

The Power and Thermal Monitoring module tracks power and thermal metrics from supported SNMP-enabled devices, including PDUs, UPSs, and CRAC units. Access detailed device insights directly through the Room Layout View for streamlined monitoring.

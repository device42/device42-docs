Discover, track, and manage warranty information and SSL certificates across your IT infrastructure.

### Storage Discovery

Storage Discovery offers agentless, vendor-neutral visibility into leading storage vendors like EMC, NetApp, Pure Storage, Hitachi, IBM, and more. 

Device42 gathers and normalizes performance, configuration, and capacity data across storage arrays, servers, switches, and everything from physical spindles to virtual machine file systems.

### DCIM Thermal and Power Management

The Power and Thermal Monitoring module tracks power and thermal metrics from supported SNMP-enabled devices, including PDUs, UPSs, and CRAC units. Access detailed device insights directly through the Room Layout View for streamlined monitoring.

### Resource Utilization and Cloud Recommendation Engine

Resource Utilization (RU) gathers statistical data on a machine’s disk, network I/O, CPU, and memory utilization over time. The data is used by Device42’s Cloud Recommendation Engine (CRE) to provide the exact details needed to plan your next cloud migration. The CRE compares costs between different cloud service providers (CSPs) to right-size your next cloud deployment.

## Core Use Cases

### **Deep & Wide Infrastructure Discovery**
Device42 provides agentless, automatic discovery of your entire IT infrastructure, including physical servers, VMs, network devices, containers, end-user devices, storage arrays, and more—along with their critical relationships—across on-premises, virtual, and cloud environments.

### **IT Inventory and Asset Management**
Device42 delivers robust IT asset management (ITAM) documentation for all your infrastructure deployments. Its powerful tools ensure IT teams have instant access to a complete, accurate, and up-to-date inventory of their entire IT environment.

### **Software License Management**
Organizations can create and maintain a comprehensive, accurate profile of the software deployed on Windows and Linux machines across the entire IT estate—from the server to the desktop level.

### **Business Service Mapping**
Business Service Mapping automatically uncovers application and service dependencies across your network, delivering unmatched insights. It seamlessly maps communications between applications, services, and hybrid cloud or on-premise environments, giving you a complete view of your IT environment.

### **Built-in CMDB**
A comprehensive Configuration Management Database (CMDB) with the most accurate and up-to-date Configuration Item (CI) data, all centralized in one place. It maps and visualizes interdependencies, providing unmatched clarity with automated enrichment.

### **Data Center Infrastructure Management**
Leverage advanced data center infrastructure management (DCIM) and visualization tools to access dynamic, accurate diagrams of your IT environment. Device42’s powerful DCIM features streamline data center modeling with intuitive drag-and-drop editors for buildings, rooms, racks, and comprehensive cable management.

### **IP Address Management**
Built-in IP Address Management (IPAM) centralizes control of your IT infrastructure’s IP address space, providing unified visibility and management for IP tracking, assignments, and other critical functions. This ensures improved efficiency, enhanced oversight, and streamlined compliance across your network.

### **Insight+ and InsightsAI**
Out-of-the-box reports and dashboards, plus the ability to harness InsightsAI, a Chat-style interface, for creating custom reports and dashboards by generating SQL code or retrieving precise answers instantly.

### **EnrichAI®**
EnrichAI uses artificial intelligence and third-party data to add to and improve your already existing IT discovered data, across vendor, operating system, and software names, end-of-life (EOL) and end-of-support (EOS) dates, and other data.

### **Warranty and SSL Certificate Management**
Discover, track, and manage warranty information & SSL certificates across your IT infrastructure.

### **Storage Discovery**
Storage Discovery offers agentless, vendor-neutral visibility into leading storage vendors like EMC, NetApp, Pure Storage, Hitachi, IBM, and more. It gathers and normalizes performance, configuration, and capacity data across storage arrays, servers, switches, and everything from physical spindles to virtual machine file systems.

### **DCIM Thermal and Power Management**
The Power and Thermal Monitoring module tracks power and thermal metrics from supported SNMP-enabled devices, including PDUs, UPSs, and CRAC units. Access detailed device insights directly through the Room Layout View for streamlined monitoring.

### **Resource Utilization and Cloud Recommendation Engine**
Resource Utilization (RU) gathers statistics on a machine’s disk, network I/O, CPU, and memory utilization over time. That data can then be used by Device42’s Cloud Recommendation Engine (CRE) to provide exact details needed to plan your next cloud migration. It compares costs between different cloud service providers (CSPs) to right-size your next cloud deployment.

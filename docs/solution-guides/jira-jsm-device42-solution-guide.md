## Device42 JIRA Service Management discovery

A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) serves as a centralized database in an organization's IT environment, housing records of Configuration Items (CIs). It is a single source of truth for IT asset information, allowing your team to track and manage changes to items and their maintenance effectively.

Utilizing a CMDB in your team's workflows offers several advantages:

* Improved Visibility: A well-maintained CMDB offers a comprehensive and accurate view of the assets under your management. However, basic CMDBs may have data that becomes outdated and is not updated in real time.
* Better Change Management: With a CMDB, your team can monitor changes made to assets over time, including details like who made the changes when they were made, and the reasons behind them. This ensures proper documentation and approval of all changes, protecting assets from unauthorized modifications.
* Increased Efficiency: As a reliable source of asset information, a CMDB streamlines your team's work, reducing the time and effort needed to manage and maintain assets effectively.

Jira Service Management Cloud is a comprehensive service desk solution designed to optimize and elevate IT service management processes in enterprises. It offers a wide range of powerful features and tools aimed at expediting incident resolution, change management, and service request handling, resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with the Device42 + Jira connector available on the Atlassian marketplace, utilizing our cloud connector to efficiently transmit data and further augment its capabilities.


## Integrate Device42 and Jira Service Management.

If your organization operates on a smaller scale or primarily deals with employee-facing IT assets or tickets, the JSM-Jira issue-tracking combination might meet your requirements adequately. However, if you need to handle infrastructure assets, operate on a larger scale, or have plans for future scalability, opting for Device42 in conjunction with Jira is the more suitable option. This combination enables you to manage your team's tasks efficiently and directly associate them with the relevant assets controlled through Device42, serving as your Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Now we’ll show you how easy it is to set up the Device42-Jira integration.


### Integrating Device42 and JSM

With just a few minutes of setup, your Device42-Jira integration will allow you to link assets between the two systems.


### Prerequisites:

* A running Device42 v18.03.02+ virtual appliance (or newer)! 
* Update [https://device42.com/update](https://device42.com/update/) or [download a free trial](https://device42.com/download/).
* Requires either the JSM Cloud Premium or Enterprise version.

Connectivity to [connect.device42.io](http://connect.device42.io/) and access to *.atlassian.net are also required for setup.


1. Main Appliance must be able to reach [connect.device42.io](http://connect.device42.io/) and *.[atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net/)
2. An Atlassian user account and API Token will be required for authentication.


#### Setting up Device42

We’ll start by preparing Device42 for cloud service integrations. Navigate to Tools > Integrations > Cloud Services, and complete the following fields:

* D42 URL for SaaS apps (the hostname your Device42 instance is accessible on)
* Company Name
* Email

![Device42 Cloud Services](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image67.png)


Next we’ll set up a Jira integration. Navigate to Tools > Integrations > External Integrations and add a new external integration. Set the URL as the hostname for your Jira Cloud instance, like this:



![Device42 external integrations](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image66.png)




#### Installing the Device42 Jira App

The next step is to configure Jira.

**Note that the instructions below assume you are using a Jira Cloud team-managed project.**

First, on the Atlassian Marketplace, install the [Device42 for Jira Service Management](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218369/device42-for-jira-service-management) app.

After installing the app to your Jira account, configure it from Apps > Manage Your Apps > Device42 Jira Service Management > Configure.



![Jira app configuration](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image70.png)


You’ll need your verification token from Device42. To find it, return to Device42 and select Tools > Integrations > External Integrations.



![Verification token](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image69.png)


Once you’ve entered your verification token in the Jira configuration and saved the settings, the Device42 account status should show as “Linked”:





![Jira Device42 account linked](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image72.png)




#### Configuring Jira Issue Type Fields

Now, we need to configure the Jira fields to use the data in Device42.

In Jira, go to Projects > Project Settings > Issue Type and add the “External asset platform” field type to the issue types your use case requires.


![Field configuration](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image71.png)



#### Linking Device42 Records from Jira

Now we can link Jira records to Device42 records.

From any issue type that is configured with the “External asset platform” field, select the “Link Asset” function:


![Link asset](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image74.png)


Once a record is linked, it will be present on the Jira record. Selecting it will display its associated information present in Device42:


![Jira Device42 linked record](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image73.png)


![Jira Device42 linked record details](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image78.png)


Finally, back in Device42, the linked Jira record will be displayed at the bottom of the corresponding Device42 record:


![Linked issue](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image75.png)


#### Linking Jira Records from Device42

Alternatively, it’s possible to link to or create a Jira issue from within Device42. To do this, go to the Jira section of the record in Device42 and select either “Add Jira Issue” or “Link to Jira issue.”


![Linking from device42](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image77.png)


#### Customizing Syncing D42 Record Types with Jira

It’s important to note that, by default, only a subset of Device42 information is synchronized with Jira. This is controlled by a DOQL query and is customizable. You can change the DOQL queries in your Jira integration settings in Device42 at Tools > Integrations > External Integrations:


![DOQL query](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image79.png)



The `D42_Jira_Cloud_Sync_Devices` query is the default. Additional predefined queries can be selected or you can write a custom query to have more control over what is synchronized with Jira.


### More Information

The full documentation for integrating Jira with Device42 can be found in our [Jira Service Desk and Jira Cloud Integration pages](https://docs.device42.com/external-integrations/device42-jira-cloud-integration/)


### Jira Service Management Integration

In addition to integrating with regular Jira issues, Device42 can also be integrated with Jira Service Management directly through the [Device42 for Jira Service Management Assets integration](https://d42example.atlassian.net/jira/marketplace/discover/app/com.device42.insight-cloud-synchronization?installDialogOpen=true&source=mpac). See the Jira Marketplace page for details on configuration.



## Implementation


### 1.0 Sync Tab

The **Synchronization** tab is used to configure the respective object schema. Initially, the only button that will appear in the **Synchronization** tab will be **_Add Import,_** as shown in the image.

![Add import](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image52.png)

### 1.1. Add a New Object Schema Import

When you click the **_Add Import _** button, the **New Object Schema Import** form will appear.
![Object schema](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image49.jpg)

1. **Object schema.** This field is required to create the new object schema import. The field shows all object schemes on Insight
2. **External Import Token.** This field is required to create the new object schema import _(See section, Generate token for Schema on Insight.)_
3. **Cron (UTC).** This field is required to create the new object schema import and is used to automatically launch the synchronization process.
   ![Schedule](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image80.jpg)

    a. **Hourly.** You have the option of choosing discovery to run between every hour(s) and a specific time to execute the cron job.

## Custom Examples


### Example #1: Adding an additional attribute to an object type in the default object schema


#### **Use Case**

We’re likely to get requests from users to add X property to Y object type. For example, maybe they are using device custom fields in Device42 that are getting pulled in from a VMware or Cloud discovery job and they want to include that data in the object schema import or maybe there is some specific field we aren’t syncing OOTB that they would like to include. 

Now, while the below procedure covers the specific process that a user could take to add a Device Custom Field to the default object schema import in the integration, it is important to note that this same process could be applied to virtually any field/column/data point within Device42 with a one-one cardinality to the desired object type; **meaning**: this is a perfect way to add custom fields or include additional properties that we may not include in the out of the box schema. 

It can even be used to do nifty things like create additional URL fields/quick linkbacks to pages within Device42. For example, you could include an attribute called ‘D42 Software URL’ that acts as a quick link to a filtered list of all software on the device by adding a column like format('%s/admin/core/software_in_use/?advanced=device_id=%s', {d42_url}, d.device_pk) as d42_software_url to the query. 

This specific example will cover modifying the Device import to include a device custom field called ‘Application Owner’. 


#### Assumptions

1. The default object schema in the integration was used. 
2. A device custom field exists of type text – Note: We are using one called ‘Application Owner’ in our example and we have assigned values to it on a few devices.

#### Procedure


1. Identify the custom field of choice (take note of the name as we will need to reference it in a few places)
2. Add a new attribute to the Device object type

   a. From within Assets, select your object schema -> Device -> Attributes. You’ll see the list of all the attributes like in the screenshot below. 
   
   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image9.png)

   b. Scroll to the bottom and you will see a toolbar for adding a new attribute.

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image10.png)

   c. Fill out the Name and Description fields and choose Default / Text as the Type / Type Value. 

   d. Click the Add button when you’re ready to commit the attribute to the schema. 


- Next, we will switch over to our Device42 MA and navigate to Tools -> Saved DOQL Queries. Search for ‘D42_Insight_Cloud_Sync_Devices’ and note that this is the System Defined Query, meaning we cannot edit this query but we can clone it. 

- Click on the query name and click Clone DOQL Query. 

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image34.png)

- Give the query a unique name: In our example, we will call it ‘CF_D42_Insight_Cloud_Sync_Devices’

- Click into the DOQL query textbox and hit ctrl + a ctrl + c and copy it to a text editor

- In order for us to include our device custom field we need to modify the query slightly, specifically we need to add a left join to view_device_custom_fields_flat_v2 and add the desired column (our custom field) to the body of the select statement. 

- To keep this document concise/legible, the full query isn’t included but below are the modifications that need to be made

- Copy: left outer join view_device_custom_fields_flat_v2 dcf ON d.device_pk = dcf.device_fk and paste it directly after the line from view_device_v2 d

- Copy: dcf."Application Owner" AS application_owner and paste it directly above the line from view_device_v2 d (remember to add a comma after the previous column or you will get a syntax error when trying to save the DOQL query)
 
- At this point you can copy/paste the query back into the Saved DOQL Query in Device42 and hit save. Note: It won’t let you save invalid SQL and you can hit the Test SQL button as well to ensure the query is syntactically valid. 

- Next we will switch back over to JSM, navigate to Apps -> Device42 Insight Connect

   a. Expand the Device object import and click on the Edit DOQL button

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image36.png)

   b. You should see that it says ‘D42_Insight_Cloud_Sync_Devices’ – That is the name of the default saved doql query that we cloned earlier. 

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image37.png)

   c. We’re going to change this to the name of the new Saved DOQL Query we just created. If you’re following along, we called ours ‘CF_D42_Insight_Cloud_Sync_Devices’. So go ahead and change the name to that and hit save to update the query.

- The very last thing we need to do now before we can run the sync is to add our attribute to the import. 

   a. You will see a dropdown box in the top row that you can click to search for the Insight attribute that we defined earlier

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image39.png)


   b. In the Device42 Attribute text box, enter the same name that was used for the column name/alias in the query, in our example that is application_owner

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image40.png)


   c.Click the Add button when you are ready to commit the attribute to the import. You should see a message that says ‘The field was successfully registered’. 

- At this point we are done and can run the sync (scroll back up and click on Sync) – you should see a message that says ‘Sync task was launched successfully’

   a. Check the status of the sync by clicking on Sync status

   b. Once the sync completes, navigate back to the object schema in Assets and search for a device that would have a value for the specified custom field. 

   c. We can see our new attribute ‘Application Owner’ has been added and the value from the custom field in D42

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image41.png)

   d. We can also see the specific date/time when a value for that field was added to our object in Assets

   ![alt_text](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image42.png)


### Example #2: Adding an additional object type to the default schema


#### Use Case

We’re likely to get requests from users to add additional objects and attributes into Assets with the Device42 JSM Assets integration. For example: Device42 discovers installed Software and Certificates that exist on a device. These are 2 objects that are NOT created as part of the out-of-the-box default schema with the integration. However, following the guided steps below, this can be accomplished within the integration to enrich and automate the data that exists within JSM Assets. Now, while the below procedure covers the specific process that a user could take to add installed Software on a device, it is important to note that this same process could be applied to virtually any configuration item/object and attribute that exists within Device42. 


#### Assumptions


1. The default object schema in the integration was used. 
2. A device has been discovered in Device42 with installed Software (Software in Use) records.


#### Procedure


1. Add a new object type in JSM Assets and call it Software In Use or your name of choice. Select Create when completed.

![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image43.png)

2. Now you will want to add attributes to this Software In Use object type.

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image44.png)

   a. From within Assets, select your object schema -> Software In Use -> Attributes. 

   b. You will now want to create a list of attributes that will appear for your Software In Use object. Use the toolbar for adding a new attribute

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image45.png)

   c. Use the view above or table below to add the: Name, description, Type and Type Value for each of the attributes. You will need to select Add to commit the attribute to the Object schema. **Note:** For the last attribute, Device, the Type needs to be set to Object the Type Value is going to be Device with an Additional Value set to Reference. This is what will relate Software in Use (Installed Software) to the Device object in JSM Assets. When configuring the reference, keep the Cardinality to 1 as the Software in Use record can only have 1 device related to it.

| Name         | Description                              | Type    | Type Value | Additional Value   |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|---------|------------|--------------------|
| Key          |                                          | Default | Text       |                    |

Configurations on to the Device42 side:


   - Next, we will switch over to our Device42 Main Appliance and navigate to Tools ->Integrations -> Saved DOQL Queries. You’ll notice there are a number of System Defined queries that you can leverage or even clone by selecting the query and then selecting ‘Clone DOQL Query’. 

   - For this example, we are going to create a new query so select ‘Add Saved DOQL Query’ in the top right.

   - Now type a Name for the query, we used ‘Insight_Cloud_Sync_Software_In_Use_V2’ and paste the following query in the DOQL Query section:

   ```
   SELECT
      s.name
      ,siu.version
      ,siu.device_fk
      ,siu.software_fk
      ,siu.softwareinuse_pk
      ,siu.first_detected
      ,siu.last_updated
      ,format('%s/admin/rackraj/software_detail/%s/', {d42_url}, siu.softwareinuse_pk) as d42_item_url
   FROM view_softwareinuse_v1 siu
   JOIN view_software_v1 s ON siu.software_fk = s.software_pk
   WHERE siu.last_updated >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 DAY'
   ```

   - You can select ‘Test’ to validate it is correct and then Save it and you should see the following:
   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image33.png)

   **Note:** In this example, we are looking at any software that was updated now until the last 1 day, to look for software on devices where we are currently running daily discoveries on. 


Back to JSM Assets side:

   - Next we will switch back over to JSM Assets, navigate to Apps -> Device42 Insight Connect

   - Select ‘Add object to sync’ so we can sync the Software In Use or Installed Software from Device42


   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image19.png)


   - Now enter the name of the Saved DOQL Query that you saved in step 3 in the box ‘DOQL’ and then select the new object type you’ve created in JSM Assets called ‘Software in Use’

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image20.png)


   - Next you will want to enter each of the Device42 attributes and then select the Insight attribute you want that value to map to. Select ‘Add’ when you are ready to commit each attribute to the import. 

   * You can obtain the name of the Device42 attributes from the name of the columns you’ve indicated in your query saved in Device42. 

   ![alt_text](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image21.png)


   * **Note:** When you add the first attribute, you will have to check the ‘Id’ box next to it so it can register the attribute or you will see the following error:

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image22.png)


   * Once you are have entered in all the attributes, you should see something like the below:

   ![](/assets/images/jsm-solution-guide/image23.png)


   * **Note:** For the very last attribute titled device_fk, this will map to the Device attribute in Insight and it is also the only mapping that will require you to enter a value for the Object attribute mapping. Please select the ‘D42 ID’. This is what will link the Software In Use to the Device. 


   - At this point we are done and can run the sync (scroll back up and click on Sync) – you should see a message that says ‘Sync task was launched successfully’


   - Check the status of the sync by clicking on Sync status

   - Once the sync completes, navigate back to the object schema in Assets and you should start to see values populating for Software In Use. 

   - If you look at a device that should have Software on it, you should now see an Inbound Reference to the Software In Use for that device.

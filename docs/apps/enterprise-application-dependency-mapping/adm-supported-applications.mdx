### Currently Supported Applications

Enterprise Application Dependency Mapping will discover **_all running services, whether or not they are on this list_**.

The following is a list of applications that Enterprise Application Dependency Mapping can additionally create application components for.

Additionally, for any application not on this list you can leverage the use of [Application Component Templates](apps/application-components/application-component-templates.md) to automate Application Component creation with custom logic that will supplement the discovery processes of Device42.

title: "Application Dependency Mapping"
---

The Application Dependency Mapping module allows Device42 to autodiscover application dependencies and service dependencies on a deeper level throughout your network.

## **ADM Module Features include:**

- **Discover services to services mappings**: Device42 can show you which service on a machine/instance is connected to what other service(s) on other machines.
- **Automatic app component grouping**: auto-add application components based on groupings of services on a server. For example, once we discover different Oracle services running on a machine, those will be automatically grouped together as an Oracle application.
- **Grab the configuration data for major applications**: e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cold Fusion, IIS and Apache httpd, etc. With this, you are able to see config details (and for some software, the actual configuration file contents) for the applications from within Device42.
- **Automatic Periodic Sampling Jobs** for both Ports and Database Connections gives a comprehensive view of applications using these resources over time.  This will enhance the discovery beyond a point-in-time usage.

Select _Apps > Services > Ignored Services_ to view, edit, or add ignored services. Click the ignored service ID to edit an existing service.

Ignored services are either Active or Inactive:

- Active ignored services are not captured in discovery.
- Inactive ignored services are captured in discovery.

Any discovered ignored services are added to the Ignored Services page. You can edit an individual ignored service to change its ignored status or use the Action menu to edit multiple services. You can also add ignored services manually if you want.

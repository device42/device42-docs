Application Components are intended to capture what people generally think of as "Applications." An application might be a CEO Dashboard that requires a web server/farm, an app server, and a database server. An application component might also be linked to just one service. Or an application component might be defined without any underlying service.

### Defining Application Components Based on Services

Each Service Instance edit form has an option to link that service with an Application Component.

In the example below, we've linked the "Oracle Recovery" service with the "Oracle Database Server" Application Component.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Edit service instance"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/service-instance-appcomp-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/service-instance-appcomp-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

If you navigate to the edit form for an Application Component, you can also link one or more services from that screen:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Editing the application component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/edit-service-instances-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/edit-service-instances-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Defining Application Components Not Based on Services

Device42 automatically categorizes application components by **Database** or **Web Server**. You can filter the list page based on this **Category**, and can categorize your custom components as well.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Application components list view"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/categories-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/categories-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Let's create a new application component with dependencies. All of the dependencies will show up in impact charts, impact lists, and dependency graphs.

- For example, let's define a "store" that depends on a device named "storeeasytp9225". If we like, we can also identify the **Responsible Customer or Department**, and choose which organizational groups are affected by this application component.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Add affected groups to application component"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/store-edit-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/store-edit-dark.png'),
    }}
  />


- Next we will define an "Main Exchange Server" component:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Defining an exchange server component top screen"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/exchange-server-basic-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/exchange-server-basic-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- The "Main Exchange Server" component will have a dependency on the "store" component and we'll **Save** the new component.
  
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Defining an exchange server component bottom screen"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/store-example-dependency-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/store-example-dependency-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Then we will add an "Outlook Web Access (OWA)" component.
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Adding an OWA component top screen"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/add-OWA-example-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/add-OWA-example-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- And add the "Main Exchange Server" component as shown below:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Adding an OWA component bottom screen"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/add-exchange-appcomp-example-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-components/add-exchange-appcomp-example-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

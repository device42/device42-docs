These sections cover the following entries found in the **Applications** menu of the Device42 Main Appliance. Explore these categories in the docs using the sidebar on the left.

- **[Application Dependency Mapping](enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/)** provides information about the autodiscovery of application and service dependencies throughout a network.
- **[Application Components](application-components/)** are discovered components such as databases, web servers, and load balancers. See a complete list of Device42â€™s supported applications here: **[ADM supported applications](apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-supported-applications)**.
- **[Application Groups](/apps/application-groups/index.mdx)** (previously known as Affinity Groups) offer an opinionated view of the impactful applications and their dependencies in your environment.
:::tip
Get started with Application Groups by defining the Starting Point in a [Calculation Rule](application-groups/calculation-rules), running one of the predefined rules, and accepting Application Group Suggestions.
:::
- **[Business Services](business-services/)** allow you to design and customize your map of critical business functions.

The [Services](services/index.mdx) section provides details on each of the **Services** options available in the Main Appliance **Resources** menu.

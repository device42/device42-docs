These sections cover the following entries found in the applications menu of the Device42 Main Appliance. Explore these categories in the docs using the sidebar on the left.

- [Application Dependency Mapping](enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/) provides information about the autodiscovery of application and service dependencies throughout a network.
- The [Application Components](application-components/) refer to discovered components such as databases, web servers, and load balancers. See a complete list of Device42â€™s supported applications here: [ADM supported applications](apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-supported-applications).
- [Application Groups](/apps/application-groups/index.mdx) (previously known as *Affinity Groups*) are an opinionated view of the impactful applications and their dependencies in your environment.
:::tip
Get started with Application Groups by defining the Starting Point in a [Calculation Rule](application-groups/calculation-rules), running one the predefined rules, and accepting app group suggestions.

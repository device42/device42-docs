## Affinity Groups Overview

:::note
Affinity Groups have been renamed to **Application Groups**. AppFocus Filters are now called **Application Group Calculation Rules**
:::

Affinity Groups assists customers and partners with application grouping activities based on observed communication patterns.

### Pinned Services

Affinity Groups uses the concept of pinned services. Pinned services represent the ‘core dependencies’ of your infrastructure, and discovered database services are automatically pinned by default. Affinity group impact charts are only created for servers with pinned services, and you are free to pin other services you consider important, as well.

After discovery has been run within your environment _(we recommend a 30-day minimum period)_, the detailed application dependency information that has been collected should now be ready to use with Affinity Groups. The collected information includes service names and communication details, and affinities are then calculated based on client communication to a particular service listening on a TCP or UDP port and server process. Users define services critical to their use case, and then Affinity Groups are processed. The result is a visualized grouping of communication patterns.

## Using Affinity Groups - How-To

From the Device42 menu, navigate to **Applications > Affinity Groups**.

From this screen, enter your search criteria and click the **Chart** link next to the Affinity Group you'd like to view. Affinity Groups are automatically calculated daily at 2 AM for all pinned services.

Application Component Categories are now also used in Affinity Groups. Any Application Component Categories associated with a device used to create an Affinity Group will be associated with the Affinity Group. You can now quickly drill down to your discovered database impact Affinity Groups or web server dependency Affinity Groups at the click of a button.

### Pinning other 'Core' services

Affinity Groups are only generated for your Core services, which are those services that have been pinned in Device42. If you don't see the Affinity Group Impact Chart you're looking for, ensure you've pinned the relevant services. Note that only pinned service listeners will lead to the formation of an Affinity Group.

Navigate to your critical Core services and pin them using the dropdown menu:

### Database Services - Pinned by default

Database services are considered 'core services' and are therefore pinned automatically. Notice the green checkmarks indicating they are already pinned:

### Viewing Affinity Group Impact Charts

Simply click the **Chart** link next to an Affinity Group name to display the associated Affinity Group Impact Chart. Use the controls at the left of the charts to highlight or search for Affinity Group Dependencies in the chart.

Note that Application Components are now displayed as stand-alone nodes, and are connected to any associated services and/or devices via dotted lines. You can also now run a **Service Dependencies Report** for Affinity Groups from the Affinity Group chart view page. The Services Dependencies report details all the communications for devices within an Affinity Group.

### Affinity Group Timelines

Affinity Group timelines make it easy to see how a given Affinity Group changed over time. Changes to both Devices and Services are marked along the timeline, indicating when devices and/or services were added or removed from each Affinity Group. The timeline can also be used to quickly navigate to specific dates of interest, including those when changes occurred.

Click on a vertical point in the timeline at the bottom of the chart to see a summary of changes. Click **Show Details** to see more information about the changes.

### Affinity Group Calculations

With Affinity Group calculations users can view an Affinity Group calculation from just about any device — open the hamburger menu, and choose **Affinity Group Calculation**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/affinity-groups/affinity-group-calculation-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

On the Affinity Group Calculation page, you can see the dependencies of the selected device or database. Click on the device to open the summary of the device and two buttons. Click on **View** to see more information on the device, or click on **Topology** for a detailed association map.

  }}

## Add Affinity Groups to a Business Application

You can now use a new command on the Affinity Group list page to quickly and easily add multiple affinity groups to an existing or new business application. Simply click up to five affinity groups on the list page and select **Add Affinity Groups to Business Applications** from the Actions menu.

Select the Business Application you want, or add a new one, and click **Add objects to the Business Application**.

The Affinity Groups added will be visible on the Business Application canvas. The Devices in each Affinity Group added will have their own color. There are up to five different colors used to help indicate which devices came from which Affinity Group.

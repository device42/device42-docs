## Overview

:::note
Affinity Groups have been renamed **Application Groups**. AppFocus Filters are now called [**Application Group Calculation Rules**](calculation-rules).
:::

Application Groups are an opinionated view of the impactful applications and their dependencies in your environment. They are configurable via [Calculation Rules](calculation-rules) (and templates). Application Groups are based on the communication patterns observed in your environment.

After discovery has been run within your environment (we recommend a 30-day minimum period), the detailed application dependency information that has been collected should now be ready to use with Application Groups.

The collected information includes service names and communication details. Application Groups are then calculated based on client communication to a particular service listening on a TCP or UDP port and server process. 

You define the services critical to your use case, before Application Groups are processed. The result is a visualized grouping of communication patterns.

### Pinned Services

Application Groups use the concept of pinned services. Pinned services represent the ‘core dependencies’ of your infrastructure, and discovered database services are automatically pinned by default. Application Group impact charts are only created for servers with pinned services, and you are free to pin other services you consider important, as well.

:::note
Pin Application Groups to keep important items at the top of the list.

## Using Application Groups - How-To

Please note that you need a ADM license to use Application Groups. Please email support at [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com) to enable this module in your Main Appliance.

From the Device42 menu, navigate to **Applications > Application Groups**.

From this screen, enter your search criteria and click the **Chart** link next to the Application Group you'd like to view. Application Groups are automatically calculated daily at 2 AM for all pinned services.

Application Component Categories are now also used in Application Groups. Any Application Component Categories associated with a device used to create an Application Group will be associated with the Application Group. You can now quickly drill down to your discovered database impact Application Groups or web server dependency Application Groups at the click of a button.

### The **Settings** Page and Templates

To navigate to the Application Group settings, click the **Settings** button in the top right corner of the Application Groups page.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Run Application Group from the ellipsis menu"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/settings-button-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/settings-button-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

From the settings page, you can:

- Enable or disable Application Groups.
- See the **Status** of the Application Group processing and the **Last Processed** date and time.
- Create and manage Calculation Logic Templates, which allow you to define the rules and conditions regarding Application Group dependencies. You'll specify which Logic Template to use when configuring a [Calculation Rule](calculation-rules#create-a-new-calculation-rule) to generate Application Groups.

You can use the predefined **D42 Default Template** or create your own. See [Calculation Rules](calculation-rules#calculation-logic-templates) for descriptions of the Logic Template fields and how the templates fit into the ADM workflow.

### Processing Application Groups

By default, enabled Application Groups are calculated daily at 2 AM. You can run Application Groups at any time from several locations in the UI:

- Click the **ellipsis icon** and select **Run Background processing**.
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Run Application Group from the ellipsis menu"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/my-ag-ellipsis-run-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/my-ag-ellipsis-run-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Bulk run selected Application Groups from the **Actions** menu by selecting **Run Background processing**.
  
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Bulk run Application Groups"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/my-ag-bulk-run-action-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/my-ag-bulk-run-action-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Select and Application Group from the list page and click **Process Now**.
  
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Process Application Group now"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/ag-process-now-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/ag-process-now-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

Hover over the status chip for processing details.

### Issues Processing Application Groups

**Unmanaged Application Groups**

Application Groups won't run unless they are associated with a Calculation Rule. If you updated a legacy Affinity Group with a single resource, or have deleted an associated Calculation Rule, you'll see the following notification:

>The Application Group is unmanaged as it has no Calculation Rule associated. In order to add it to processing, add a fixed rule with the items in focus.

![Unmanaged Application Group Notification](/assets/images/application-groups/unmapped-ag-notice.png)

Edit or create a new rule and [select **Fixed** as the **Starting Point**](calculation-rules#starting-points) and add the orphaned resource to the rule. 

**Invalidated Application Groups**

- If you change the **Group By** configuration of a Calculation Rule, the Application Group will be invalidated. You'll get the following message:
  > This Application Group has been invalidated because its AppFocus no longer matches its Calculation Rule.

  ![Invalidated Application Group Notification](/assets/images/application-groups/invalidated-ag-notice.png)

  Reverting to the exact original **Group By** value will reactivate the existing application group.

- If an associated Calculation Rule included a custom field grouping and that custom field is deleted, the Application Group will be invalidated and processing will fail. 

  > Could not find the Custom Field to group by. Please check the Calculation Rule configuration.

### Pinning other 'Core' services

Application Groups are only generated for your Core services, which are those services that have been pinned in Device42. If you don't see the Application Group Impact Chart you're looking for, ensure you've pinned the relevant services. Note that only pinned service listeners will lead to the formation of an Application Group.

Navigate to your critical Core services and pin them using the dropdown menu:

### Database Services - Pinned by default

Database services are considered 'core services' and are therefore pinned automatically. Notice the green checkmarks indicating they are already pinned:

## Impact **Charts** 

- Click on a **Chart** link next to an Application Group name under the **My Application Groups** tab to view the Application Group Impact Chart.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Chart links"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/chart-links-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/chart-links-dark.png'),
    }}
  />  

The Application Group Impact Chart displays the relationships between Application Components, services, and devices.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Application Group Impact Chart"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/apache-cluster-chart-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/apache-cluster-chart-dark.png'),
    }}
  />  

### Chart Usability Tips  

Use the left panel controls to highlight or search for dependencies and items of interest. 

You'll be prompted to save the position of the nodes after you've moved them, or do so preemptively by clicking the **Save Node Positions** button.

- Focus on a node in the chart view using the **microscope icon**.

  ![Panel controls](/assets/images/application-groups/focus-control.gif)
  
### Relationship Lines and Metadata

[Application Components](application-components/index) are displayed as stand-alone nodes, and are connected to any associated services and devices via dotted lines.  

Impact charts include Global and Local Views. Only Application Components that are focus items are displayed in the Global View.

Click the dependency lines in the Global View to open the Local View panel displaying those relationships. 

- From the Local View, click the dependency lines between services, processes, and devices to see connection-related details and statistics: **Listener IP/FQDN**, **Protocol**, **Port**, and **Net\* Average Connections** over time (if available). 
- The dotted lines link to Application Components: the **Reason** and **What is affected** values are displayed (if available).

If you don't see this historical communication metadata, make sure you have the [**Store and Display Connection Metadata** option enabled in **Visualization** options](calculation-rules#visualization-options) of that Application Group's Calculation Rule.

      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/oracle-chart-dark.png'),
    }}
  />  

You can also run a **Service Dependencies Report** for from the chart view page. The Services Dependencies report details all the communications for devices within an Application Group.

## Application Group Timelines

Application Group timelines make it easy to see how a given group changed over time. Changes to services and resources are marked along the timeline, indicating when they were added or removed from the group. 

The timeline can also be used to quickly navigate to specific dates of interest, including those when changes occurred.

- Click on the **Time Settings** icon to open the timeline.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Time Settings icon"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/time-settings-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/time-settings-dark.png'),
    }}
  /> 

- In the timeline, select a vertical point at the bottom of the chart to see a summary of changes. Click **Show Details** to open a panel listing and linking to the changed items.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Time Settings icon"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/timeline-see-details-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/timeline-see-details-dark.png'),
    }}
  /> 

- View the changes to dependency and non-dependency Application Group relationships to the timeline. Non-dependency relationships refer to those with Application Components and some resource-to-resource relationships.

## View the Calculation of Devices

With Application Group calculations, you can view an Application Group calculation from just about any device — open the hamburger menu, and choose **Application Group Calculation**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Application group calculation option"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/affinity-group-calculation-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/affinity-group-calculation-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/calculation-rules/10.92.11.208_admin_core_device_14135_affinity_group_calc_light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/calculation-rules/10.92.11.208_admin_core_device_14135_affinity_group_calc_dark.png'),
  }}
/>

On the Application Group Calculation page, you can see the dependencies of the selected device or database. Click on the device to open the summary of the device and two buttons. Click on **View** to see more information on the device, or click on **Topology** for a detailed association map.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/application-groups/affinity-group-calculation-view-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Add Application Groups to a Business Services

You can now use a new command on the Application Group list page to quickly and easily add multiple Application Groups to an existing or new business application. Simply click up to five Application Groups on the list page and select **Add Application Groups to Business Applications** from the Actions menu.

![](/assets/images/WEB-721_Affinity_Groups_Pic9.png)

Select the Business Service you want, or add a new one, and click **Add objects to the Business Application**.

![](/assets/images/WEB-721_Affinity_Groups_Pic10.png)

The Application Groups added will be visible on the Business Application canvas. The Devices in each Application Group added will have their own color. There are up to five different colors used to help indicate which devices came from which Application Group.

![](/assets/images/WEB-721_Affinity_Groups_Pic11.png)

### Business Service Dependency Alerts

Business Services that were created from Application Groups can be configured to send alerts when dependencies are added or removed. There is a metadata linking Business Services to the Application Groups they were created from. 

:::note
Alerts on Business Applications prior to v19.05 (now Business Services) will no longer work. Please re-add the Application Group to the Business Service to enable alerts. Business Application alerts have been improved to be less noisy and more accurate and targeted.
:::

Navigate to **Analytics > Setup Alerts** and then click **Create**:

- Set **Business Service** from the available **Rule Types**.
- You can choose to be notified when a **New Application Group [is] Found** or when an **Application Group [is] Removed**. 
- Choose the Business Service you want to monitor from the **Available objects** list.
- Edit the **Notification Template** as needed.
- Add a webhook endpoint to receive the alert, if required.

## Using Business Applications

Device42 Business Applications offers a powerful way to build custom maps of business critical functions. Besides looking different than [Affinity Groups](/apps/affinity-groups/index.mdx), Business Applications are also different because they are not automatically built out based solely on discovered connections and devices. Business Applications can be totally designed and customized by you, and can _include any and all of the resources that you identify as critical to your business!_

Using Business Applications, you'll be able to catalog all of your business and mission-critical applications. All of the following are possible:

- Creating Business Applications from scratch or from existing Affinity Groups
- Adding and removing devices and connectivity
- Customizing the resource layout, connections, and their labels
- Saving customized layout(s) and returning to edit them at any time

- Select _Applications > Business Applications_ from the Device42 menu to display a list of existing applications.

- Click on a Business Application _Name_ to view details about the application.

![](/assets/images/D42-23306_biz-app-view-page.png)

**Note:**  Business Applications display information about any Devices and Application Components associated with the Business Application. (Device42 automatically categorizes application components as Database, Application Layer, Web Server, Load Balancer, or Other.) Application Component information also appears on the Business Application visualization canvas (see below).

- Click _View Application_ to see the visualization of the application.  Click the _Edit_ button at the top right to turn edit mode on.

![](/assets/images/D42-23306_biz-app-canvas.png)

The page displays the business application name; hover over _Application Details_ to see information about the application. The left panel contains icons for adding devices, affinity groups, or application components to your business application and a menu bar above the icons.  You can also now run a _Service Dependencies Report_ for the Business Application, which details all the communications for the devices within the Business Application.

Click a device, affinity group, or application component object on the canvas to see details about that item. Links in the details box or below the object take you to the view pages for those items.

## Add a Business Application

- Select _Applications > Business Applications_ from the Device42 menu to display the applications list, and then click _Add Business Application_.

![](/assets/images/D42-23306_biz-app-add-page.png)

- Enter the application _Name_ and select the _Application Type_ (COTS, COTS with Customization, or Custom) and add a _Description_ if wanted.
- Use the magnifying glass icons to select or enter the _Technical Application Owner_, _Business Application Owner_, and _Responsible Customer or Department_.
- Use the format **1w 2d 3h 4m 5s** (1 week, 2 days, 3 hours, 4 minutes, and 5 seconds) to denote the time period for _DR Recovery Point Objective_ and _DR Recovery Time Objective_. The individual terms are optional and numbers must be integers. For example, you can enter **2d 6h** to define two days and six hours.
- Select or enter the _Migration Group_ and _Criticality_, and add any _Notes_ or _Tags_ you want.
- Click _Save_ at the bottom right of the page to save the application and add it to the applications list page.

### Add Devices

- To add a device to a business application, drag a _Device_ block to the canvas – this will open the Add Device box.  You can _Search_ for a device by the device name, service level, tag, or service name.
- Select a device from the list, and then click **Add**. Device42 adds the device to the canvas.

![](/assets/images/D42-23306_biz-app-add-device-popup.png)

### Add Affinity Groups

Efficiently keep track of changes and additions of devices by setting up an affinity group. After adding an affinity group to an application, configure an alert to send notifications when devices are added or changed to the affinity group. First, add a new affinity group as follows: 

- Drag an _Affinity Group_ block to the canvas – this will bring up the Add Affinity Group box.  You can _Search_ by group type, group name, tag, primary device name, or service name
- When you click on a group in the list, you will see the number of devices in that group.
- Select an affinity group from the list, and then click **Add**. Device42 adds the Affinity Group with all its devices and connections to the canvas.

![](/assets/images/D42-23306_biz-app-add-affinity-group-popup.png)

#### Add an Alert

Next set up the alert. Select _Analytics > Setup Alerts_ from the Device42 menu bar and then click _Add Alert_ on the Select Alert to view page.

![](/assets/images/WEB-219_Alerts_Add-Alert-page.jpg)

- Enter a **Name** for the alert, and then select the **Rule Type** for the alert. Each Rule Type has associated Triggers, which define the conditions that will generate an alert.
- Select the **Trigger** you want for the Rule Type you selected.
- Select the **Alert Type**.
    - If you select **D42 Notification**, select or add the **Escalation Profile** to use for the alert. You use Escalation Profiles to set up email notification escalation tiers. Select _Tools > Admins & Permissions > Escalation Profiles_ to add or edit escalation profiles.
    - If you select **Alert Integration**, select or add the alert integration (for example, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, etc.) to use for the alert. Select _Tools > Integrations > External Integrations_ to view or add external integrations. Also see [https://www.device42.com/integrations/](https://www.device42.com/integrations/) for more information about Device42 integrations.

As you construct your alert, Device42 displays the alert definition based on the options you select or enter. The example below shows an Operating System Count alert that sends a notification to the Alert Group 1 escalation profile.

![](/assets/images/WEB-219_Alerts_Contructed-OS-alert-example.jpg)

Depending on the alert Rule Type you select, you may also see an **Apply To:** option that you use to select the objects you want to apply the alert to. Use the _Available objects_ list on the left to select the objects you want to add to the _Chosen objects_ list on the right.

**Additional Options**

- **Priority** — Critical, High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority
- **Resend Notification** — Amount of time (in seconds) to wait before sending an email notification for the alert. Leave this field blank to send the email only once.
- **Seconds Before Action** — Amount of time (in seconds) that the alert condition (the trigger) exists before the Device42 generates the alert.
- **Job Interval Factor Before Action** — (Displayed for specific power alerts in place of Seconds Before Action.) Trigger the action only if the condition persists for the Job Interval Factor times the polling rate for associated jobs. Default value is 1.

![](/assets/images/D42-26290_alerts-job-interval.jpg)

- **Notes** — Any notes about the alert.
- **Notification Template** — Text fields you can use to create templates for the Subject and Message of the alert email.

When you are done, click **Save** at the bottom of the page to save the alert.

See [Alert Rule Types and Triggers](/reports/reports/setup-alerts-and-notifications/#alert-rule-types-and-triggers) for more information.
#### View Notifications

If you select _D42 Notification_ as the _Alert Type_ when you create an alert, Device42 generates a notification when the alert condition triggers the alert. 

Select _Analytics > Notifications_ from the menu bar to go to the **Notifications** page.

![](/assets/images/WEB-219_Alerts_Banner-Bell-icon-1.jpg)

The page displays notifications for all triggered alerts whose _Alert Type_ is _Device42 Notification_. Click **My Notifications** or **All Notifications** to see the notification lists.

Device42 can track purchases of devices and assets including service and warranty contracts. 

### Add a Purchase

To add a new purchase, navigate to **Infrastructure > Purchases** and click **Create**.

This example is for a hypothetical purchase of 25 Dell PE1950 servers for the R&D department charged to **Cost Center** 12056:
- To populate the **Total cost for non-recurring line items** value, fill in the **Quantity** and **Unit cost** details for the first line item.

    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/unit-costs-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/unit-costs-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Add a new purchase"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/attachment-line-item-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/attachment-line-item-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

You can attach a PDF of the purchase contract by clicking **+ Add another File Attachment** and browsing to the file.

### Line Items 

Each line item for the purchase will have a **Line Type** and an **Item Type**.

For **Line Type** choose **Contract** for service, warranty, and other contracts and choose **Device/Asset/Tax etc.** for everything else.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/line-type-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/line-type-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The **Item Type** has a list of selections that can apply to either Line Type. For example, if the Line Type is **Device/Asset/Tax etc.**, choosing **Device** for the Item Type means that this line represents one or more devices. 

If a service contract is purchased for each device, you can include a second line item with a Line Type of Contract and Item Type of Device to represent the service contracts for the purchased devices.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Item type options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/item-type-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/item-type-dark.png'),
  }}
/>



<ThemedImage
  alt="Line item 1 example"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/line-item-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/line-item-1-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '110%' }} 
/>

A few things to note:  
1. If the **Line Type** is **Contract** a set of extra fields like **Frequency** will become available.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Contract type"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/contract-line-type-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/purchases/contract-line-type-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

2. You can assign a **Cost Center** and **Customer** at either the purchase header level (applies to all line items) or the individual line item level.  
3. You can associate the actual devices purchased with the line item. This can be done at the time of purchase or a later date.

### Enabling and Disabling Monitoring

Select one or more power units that you no longer need to be monitored on the list page. Choose **Disable monitoring for selected devices, but keep data** or **Disable monitoring for selected devices and delete data**, depending on what you want to do with the already-discovered data. 

Re-enable monitoring with the **Enable monitoring for selected Power Units** bulk action.

After selecting an action, click on the **hammer icon** to execute it.

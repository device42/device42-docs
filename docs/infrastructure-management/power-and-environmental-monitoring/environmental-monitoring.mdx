The PDU discovery process will automatically find any environmental sensors that are attached to your PDUs, including heat, temperature, and humidity sensors. 

## Discovering Environmental Sensors via PDUs

Power units are discovered via the SNMP Discovery option in the Discovery menu; See the 'Power Unit Autodiscovery' section of [Getting started with Power and Environmental Monitoring"](infrastructure-management/power-and-environmental-monitoring/getting-started-with-power-and-environmental-monitoring.mdx) to learn how to discover power units or PDUs.

## Viewing Discovered Sensors

When sensors are discovered, they are created along with an asset record in Device42. To view all discovered sensors, head to the main menu, **Resources > All Assets** and filter the **Type** by **Sensor**:

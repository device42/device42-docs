## Discovering Environmental Sensors

The PDU Discovery process will automatically find any environmental sensors that are attached to your PDUs, including heat, temperature, and humidity sensors. Power units are discovered via the SNMP Discovery option in the Discovery menu; See the 'Power Unit Autodiscovery' section of [Getting started with Power & Environmental Monitoring"](infrastructure-management/power-and-environmental-monitoring/getting-started-with-power-and-environmental-monitoring.md) to learn how to discover power units/PDUs! ![Add SNMP discovery job Power PDU](/assets/images/add_SNMP_discovery_MENU-hl.png)

## Viewing Discovered Sensors

When sensors are discovered, they are created along with an asset record in Device42. To view all discovered sensors, simply head to the main menu, _Devices -> Assets_ and filter by "Type" = Sensor: ![View discovered PDU Sensors ](/assets/images/view_all_sensors.png)

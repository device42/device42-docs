:::info
This page is about managing SSL certificates that have already been discovered by Device42. For details on creating a certificate autodiscovery job, visit [Certificate Autodiscovery](/auto-discovery/certificate-auto-discovery.mdx).

### Certificate List Page

The list page for certificates, under **Applications > Certificates**, will show you all certificates discovered in Device42 along with their validity details.

The fields include:

- Serial Number
- Is Key Encipherment
- Is Key CERT Sign
- Subject Alternative Name
- First Detected date and time
- Encryption method

You can export certificates by selecting them from the list and choosing the **Export Selected items as CSV** option from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

    dark: useBaseUrl(

    ),
  }}
/>

### Viewing Certificates

Click on the name of a certificate from the list page, under **Applications > Certificates**, to view it.

When viewing a certificate that has been imported, you can now associate FQDN, multiple devices, IPs, and different validity dates with your certificates. This allows you to have a wildcard certificate and easily see the different FQDNs or subdomains associated with it.

    ),
    dark: useBaseUrl(
      "/assets/images/certificate-management/view-certificate-dark.png"
    ),
  }}
/>

### Certificate Instances

In addition to seeing all certificates, you can now see certificate instances - allowing you to see device/IP address relationships for individual certificates. Locate certificate instances under **Applications > Certificate Instances**. Filter certificate instances based on device building, service level, and customer.

Certificate instances are also displayed in the device details view.

    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/certificate-instances-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/certificate-instances-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

### Certificate Reports

Though you can have multiple valid-to dates associated with a single certificate, Device42 reports still know to alert you based on the oldest date stored for a given certificate.

This allows you to run reports to see which devices you still need their certificates updated, allowing you to see your update progressing â€” which can prove especially useful with very large deployments.

After testing couple of printers from different manufacturers, we are only supporting the QL700 label printer from Brother

These products are available in the US from online and in store merchants including Amazon and Staples. We would love to hear feedback from international customers' and their experience.

Any label printer that can print 300x600 dpi (300x300 dpi, might be not very good quality)

Any printing/printer issues will not be supported. You can definitely ping us for any questions/ideas, but we cannot troubleshoot third party printer issues.

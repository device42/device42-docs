### Scanning the QR Code

A printed QR code contains a url to device42 appliance for that object. You can use numerous free QR readers apps (such as i-nigma) for iphone/android/. Once the reader scans the QR code, it will bring you to the login page for device42 appliance and take you to a page to manage that object.

### Managing Inventory

Basic location and inventory/asset lifecycle properties can be viewed or edited for the object.

The page is optimized for mobile devices and hence there is no menu on the top. You can click Home to get to the main menu, but it is not formatted for small screens and will not present well.  
Devices > Mobile view is where the special formatted view for mobile devices resides.

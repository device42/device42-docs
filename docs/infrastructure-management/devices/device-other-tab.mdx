As of version 19.05 and later of the Device42 UI, the **Other Tab** is only available using the device details page **Legacy** view.

In the latest versions of the UI, you can navigate to most of the sections that belonged to the **Other Tab** from the right **Breakdown** panel of the device details page. This includes:

- **Device URLs**
- **BIOS Info** (under **Details** in the **Breakdown** panel)
- **[Custom Fields](administration/custom-key-value-pairs-explained.mdx)** - create and store custom attributes
- **File Attachments** - attach files associated to this device

Port details for power units can be found under the **Ports** section on the details page of a power unit (located  **Infrastructure > Power Units**).

From version 19.05 of the Device42 UI onward, the **Other Tab** is only available using the **Legacy** view of the device details page.

In the latest versions of the UI, most of the sections that belonged to the **Other Tab** can be found in the right-hand **Breakdown** panel of the device details page. This includes:

- **Device URLs**
- **BIOS Info** (under **Details** in the **Breakdown** panel)
- **[Custom Fields](administration/custom-key-value-pairs-explained.mdx)** - used to create and store custom attributes
- **File Attachments** - used to attach files associated with the device

Port details for power units can be found under the **Ports** section on the details page of a power unit (located under **Infrastructure > Power Units**).

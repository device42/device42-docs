You can create a profile for device names to speed up device creation and help you maintain a consistent naming convention.

### Create New Device Name Profile

To create a Device Name Profile, go to **Tools > Templates & Bulk Operations > Device Name Profiles**.

In this example, we will create a device profile that will generate the device names `NH-DC-0001` through to `NH-DC-9999`.

To create a device name profile, enter:

- A required **Name** for the profile
- An optional **Prefix**, which will cause every name generated to have the prefix at the start (such as `NH-DC-`)
- An optional **Suffix**, which will cause every name generated to have the suffix at the end (no suffix in the example)
- A **Number Length** (in the example above, `4` digits is entered, which in combination with the **Start Number** parameter, results in the range `0001` to `9999`)
- A **Start Number** (usually this will be `1`, but it can be any number)

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-name-profiles/create-profile-2-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


### Create From Existing Name Profile

You can then create devices directly from the Device Name Profiles list view by clicking the **Create** link next to a profile.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-name-profiles/create-link-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


In the example, we want to create eight devices. The first created device will be named `NH-DC-xxxx`, where `xxxx` is the next number for the profile. In other words, if no devices have been created, the first device name will be `NH-DC-0001`. If the last device name created was `NH-DC-0051`, then the first of the eight new devices will be `NH-DC-0059`.

![wpid173-cluster_properties.png](/assets/images/wpid173-cluster_properties.png)

A cluster could be a server farm, an active/active cluster, an active/passive cluster, or any other logical grouping of devices that function behind a single name or IP address. To add devices in a cluster, you can click on the device(s) and use the ==> button to add those devices to that cluster. The small search box on top of devices will help you narrow down the list of devices and make it easy to add from hundreds or thousands of devices.

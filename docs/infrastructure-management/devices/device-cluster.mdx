A device cluster could be a server farm, an active-active cluster, an active-passive cluster, or any other logical grouping of devices that function behind a single name or IP address. 

### Adding a New Cluster

**Cluster** is an available device type in addition to the **physical**, **virtual**, and **unknown** device types. 

To create a new cluster, navigate to **Resources > All Devices** and click **+ Add New Device**. Select **cluster** as the device **Type** to reveal the cluster-related options.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-cluster/cluster-type-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Search for and select the devices you want to add to the cluster, and move them across to the right-hand box using the **right arrow** button.

Use the search box on top of devices to narrow down the list of devices and make it easy to add from hundreds or thousands of devices. Add new devices using the **+ (plus sign)** button.

### Changing Device Type to Cluster

Changing the device type to **cluster** is also possible for existing **physical**, **virtual** devices, or **unknown** devices. However, you'll loose data associated with the device related to its previous type.

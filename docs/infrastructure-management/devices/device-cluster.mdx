A device cluster can be a server farm, an active-active cluster, an active-passive cluster, or any other logical grouping of devices that functions behind a single name or IP address. 

### Adding a New Cluster

**Cluster** is one of the available device types, in addition to the **physical**, **virtual**, and **unknown** types. 

To create a new cluster, navigate to **Resources > All Devices** and click **+ Add New Device**. Select **cluster** as the device **Type** to reveal the cluster-related options.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-cluster/cluster-type-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Search for and select the devices you want to add to the cluster and move them across to the right-hand box using the **right arrow** button.

Use the search box to narrow down the list of available devices and make it easy to select one among hundreds or thousands of devices. Add new devices using the **+ (plus sign)** button.

### Changing Device Type to Cluster

Changing the device type to **cluster** is also possible for any existing **physical**, **virtual**, or **unknown** device. However, you'll lose data associated with the device's previous type.

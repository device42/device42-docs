## Part Slot Overview

Part slots may be added to both new and existing blade-based and non-blade hardware. Parts slots can optionally receive parts. Define parts slots on hardware templates, or add one directly to an existing hardware device.

For information on blade slots, which work similarly but accept blades instead of parts, see [Blade Slots documentation](device-blade-slots.mdx)

## Add Parts Slots to Hardware Models

Navigate to **Infrastructure > Hardware Models** and select or create a hardware model with a **Rackable**, or similar, **Physical Subtype**. 

To add a parts slot to a hardware model, click the **Model Layout** tab.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/device-model-layout-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/device-model-layout-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Youâ€™ll then be at the Hardware Model layout editor screen. You can turn edit mode on or off via the **Turn ON** button:

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/turn-on-layout-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/turn-on-layout-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Add a parts slot by dragging and dropping a **New Slot** icon at the front or the back of the chassis. You can specify the part model to put in the parts slot during this process:

  sources={{

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/new-slot-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Note About Manually Moving Parts When Using the Auto-Add Ports Option

Should you manually move one or more parts around the layout _(for example, from Slot A to Slot B)_, any ports associated with that part that were auto-added **will not automatically regenerate**. It is assumed that if you are manually moving existing parts, you are attempting to correct the location of a part.

Should you be actually **moving the physical part from one slot to another**, to represent this in Device42, you should **first remove the part from the device, save, and then add it back to its new slot**. The system will then delete all associated network ports from the device, and will auto-add new ones back to the new slot ID _(as long as auto-add ports is enabled for that hardware model)_.

## Using the Visual Model Editor

Click **Turn ON** to enable edit mode, and then drag and drop parts slots as desired. Slots that were created when the part model was defined will appear in the left column, **Unmapped Existing Parts** or **Unmapped Existing Blade Slots**:

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/unmapped-blade-slots-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/unmapped-blade-slots-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Click any parts or blade slot and click the **pencil** button in the top-right corner to reorient, rename, or place a part in a parts slot:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Edit part slot"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/edit-part-slot-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/edit-part-slot-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Editing a **Blade Slot** offers different options. When editing a blade slot, similarly to a parts slot, you may add a number or change the orientation between horizontal and vertical. However, you cannot put a part in a blade slot; instead, you have the ability to set the blade height.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/edit-blade-slot-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-parts-slots/edit-blade-slot-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

When you have finished editing your layout, **Save** the edits you made. You will see a green save confirmation in the upper left.

  }}

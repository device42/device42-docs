Cloning a device in Device42 saves time and provides consistency when adding multiple similar devices.

Navigate to **Tools > Templates & Bulk Operations > Clone Device**.

- Select a **Device to clone** using the **magnifying glass icon** and choose the properties to include in the clone(s) using the checkboxes.

    **Notes** will not be associated with the clones.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Device to Clone's name and properties"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/clone-a-device/name-and-properties-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/clone-a-device/name-and-properties-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Input the number of clones you wish to create in the **# of devices** field. Next, choose between naming all the clone(s) by selecting a **Device Name Profile** or naming each clone individually by entering a comma-separated list of names.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/clone-a-device/count-and-name-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Optionally, you can include an original **Asset Number Profile**, **Service Level**, and **Customer** to be associated with the clone(s). If you apply a new **Service Level** or **Customer** to the clone(s), be sure you deselect the relevant checkbox under **Properties** to prevent the original device property from being cloned.

- When you're ready to create the clone(s), click **Clone** in the bottom-right corner.

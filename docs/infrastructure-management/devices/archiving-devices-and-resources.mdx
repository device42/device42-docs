## Overview

You can archive devices and other resources to retire them or to take them out of service but still keep a record of the archived object. Device42 displays a list view of archived objects, and you can view and edit individual archived objects. The instructions below show how to archive a device and archive a resource.

## Archive a Device

- Go to **Resources > Compute > All Devices** to display the Devices list page.
- Click the name of the device you want to archive to display its view page, then click **Archive**.

        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/archiving-devices-and-resources/archive-button-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/archiving-devices-and-resources/archive-button-dark.png'),
    }}
    />
 

- Device42 displays an archive device prompt page. Click **Yes, I'm sure** to archive the device. Click your browser's **Back** button to return to the device's view page.

    <ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/archiving-devices-and-resources/confirm-archive-1-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/archiving-devices-and-resources/confirm-archive-1-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Archive device details"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/archiving-devices-and-resources/confirm-archive-2-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/archiving-devices-and-resources/confirm-archive-2-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

Device42 adds the device to the Archived Objects list page.

### Bulk Device Archive Option

You can archive multiple devices simultaneously using the **Fast Background Archive** command in the **Actions** menu on the Devices list page, rather than having to archive the devices individually. Select the devices you want to archive, and then select the command. Note that this command does not display a confirmation prompt.

  }}
/>

## Archive a Resource

- Go to **Resources > Resources > All Resources** to display the Resources list page.

    }}
    />


- Click **Archive** at the top right of the view page.
- Device42 displays an **Archive Object** pop-up with information about the resource. Click **Show** to see additional information; you can also add optional notes.

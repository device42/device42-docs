## Overview

You can archive devices and other resources to retire them or to take them out of service but still keep a record of the archived object. Device42 displays a list view of archived objects, and you can view and edit individual archived objects. The instructions below show how to archive a device and archive a resource.

## Archive a Device

- Go to _Resources > Compute > All Devices_ to display the device list page.
- Click the name of the device you want archive to display its view page, then click the ellipse menu and then _Archive_.

- Device42 adds the device to the Archived Objects list page.

### Bulk Device Archive Option

You can archive multiple devices simultaneously using the _Fast Background Archive_ command in the Actions menu on the Devices list page rather than having to archive the devices individually. Select the devices you want to archive, and then select the command. Note that this command does not display a confirmation prompt.

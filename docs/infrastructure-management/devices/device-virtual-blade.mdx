### Brief Description for Virtual and Blade type Devices

For virtual devices, you can choose which host it belongs to, and other properties like CPU. Memory, OS, and IP Address can be entered as described previously for physical devices.

**VMware Notes vs. Device Notes**

Notes that you add to a VMware virtual device outside of Device42 appear in the _Hypervisor Description_ field on the device view and edit pages. (If the VMware virtual device does not have notes, the field does not appear.)

Note that the _Hypervisor Description_ is separate from the Device _Notes_ field that you use to add or edit notes within Device42.

A blade device is subtype of physical devices. You can choose the blade hardware model here, who supports it, etc. You can choose the Host Chassis for this blade and a slot number as well. The other fields are similar to those discussed above in the device tab.

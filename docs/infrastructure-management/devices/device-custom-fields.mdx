Many customers create custom fields for their devices to organize them and add additional information according to their specific situations. Now custom fields can be even more useful – you can now choose to display those custom fields conveniently in device pop-up panels and on layout pages.

When you add a device custom field, simply check _Include in Context Pop-ups_ to include the custom field in panels and on layout pages.

The custom field is then included in device pop-up panels and pages. The image below shows an example with two custom fields defined for Context Pop-ups: _Console Port_ and _Application_.

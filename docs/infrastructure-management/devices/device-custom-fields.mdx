Many customers create custom fields for their devices to organize them and add additional information according to their specific situations. Now custom fields can be even more useful – you can now choose to display those custom fields conveniently in device pop-up panels and on layout pages.

When you add a device custom field, check **Include in Context Pop-ups** to include the custom field in panels and on layout pages.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Include in Context Pop-ups"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-custom-fields/context-pop-ups-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-custom-fields/context-pop-ups-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The custom field is then included in device pop-up panels and pages. The image below shows an example with two custom fields defined for Context Pop-ups: `Demo custom field` and `gci-update-strategy`.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Pop-up example"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-custom-fields/pop-up-example-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-custom-fields/pop-up-example-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can exclude devices from discovery jobs by applying Device Ignore Rules to them. You may want to apply Device Ignore Rules to devices such as network printers, fax machines, IP phone systems, etc.

Note that using Device Ignore Rules does not affect device data that has already been discovered by previous discovery jobs. Any Device Ignore Rules you apply affect only discovery jobs you run _after_ you have applied the rules. Device Ignore Rules work for all discovery jobs, including cloud discovery.

You can see Device Ignore Rule discovery results and details in the [Discovery Scores](reports/reports/discovery-quality-scores.md) page (select _Reports > Discovery Scores_ to view the page).

:::info
Ignore rules will **skip** the discovery of devices completely. An alternative option is available if you want to discover devices, but exclude specific IPs, MACSs, or Network Interfaces from the dataset. See **[Windows and Hyper-V Autodiscovery](/auto-discovery/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/#option-to-ignore-ipsmac-addresses)** for more details.

### Add a Device Ignore Rule

Select _Tools > Settings > Device Ignore Rules_ and then click _Add Device Ignore Rule_ to apply an ignore rule to a device.

Select an **Ignore device based on** option:

- Device name
- Device Type
- OS name
- Mac address prefix
- Hardware model
- Tag (device tag)

Enter any characters in **Ignored text** field for the ignore option you selected. If the character string you enter matches any portion of the corresponding attribute of a device, that device is ignored. If multiple devices have matching attributes, they are all ignored.

You can also select **Text length match type** (_Partial match_ or _Exact match_) and **Text case match type** (_Case insensitive_ or _Case sensitive_) to further define the text to ignore.

Note that the page also displays a **Last time** time stamp if the Device Ignore Rule has already been used during a discovery.

If you select **Device type** for the **Ignore device based on:** option, Device42 displays additional fields you use to select the **Device Type** and **Subtype**.

If you use the **Device type** option, select the **Type** and **Subtype** for the rule.

Click **Save** to save the Ignore Rule.

### Add Device Ignore Rules from a Device List

You can a Device Ignore Rules to one or more devices from one of the D42 device lists. Select one of the options from the _Devices_ menu – this example uses _Devices > Virtual Devices_ – and select the devices you want to apply a rule to.

Select **Ignore devices from autodiscovery** from the Action menu and then click the lighting button.

- Device name
- Device Type
- OS name
- Mac address prefix
- Hardware model
- Tag

Select the **Choose case match type attribute** drop-down (_Case insensitive_ or _Case sensitive_) and the **Choose length match type attribute** drop-down (_Partial match_ or _Exact match_) to refine the ignore rule.

Click **Create new device ignore rules** to add the rules. Device42 adds the new rules to the Device Ignore Rule list.

From version 19.05 and later of Device42, the **Properties Tab** is only available from the device details page **Legacy View**. 

The sections that were within the **Properties Tab** can be accessed from the right **Breakdown** panel of the device details page. This includes:

- **CPU Memory HardDisk** (under **Details**)
- **Device Operating Systems** (under **Details**)
- **Connectivity** (called **Ports** from version 19.05)
- **IP Addresses**
- **Device Alias**

Most fields are automatically populated by autodiscovery.

  }}
/>

### CPU Memory HardDisk

This section holds values for **Total CPUs**, **Cores/CPU**, **CPU Speed**, total **RAM**, and other hard disk drive (HDD) info. If you don't want the CPU and memory values to be changed via autodiscovery, check the **Don't change via api** option.

### Device Operating Systems

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device Operating System fields"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-os-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-os-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

The **OS** name, **OS Version**, and **OS Version #** fields are the basic operating system (OS) details for each device. If EnrichAI is active and the data is available, these fields may be automatically populated by the autodiscovery client. The vendor support details, like the **End of Life** and **End of Support** fields, may also be autopopulated. If EnrichAI is disabled, you can manually enter the relevant data or execute scripts to populate the fields. Note that the **OS License Key** field can also be entered manually. 

The **Count In Licensing** option is checked by default and can be unchecked if it doesn't count towards the OS licensing for the device OS. Check the **Don't change via api** option if you don't want the property values to be changed via autodiscovery.

Note that if the Operating System fields are blank, you may need to rerun autodiscovery.

### Rack Info

Rack information is no longer shown under the device **Properties** tab. To locate the list of physical devices, navigate to **Resources > All Assets**. You can view and edit rack information by clicking on an asset and scrolling to the **Rack Info** section. 

### Ports Connectivity

From the **Ports** section, you can **Add New** and **Add Existing** connections. You can also **Edit** connections or delete them using the **trash can** icon at the far right (not pictured). 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Ports"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/connectivity-ports-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/connectivity-ports-dark.png'),
  }}
/> 

### IP Addresses

Add an IP address to the device by clicking the **Add New** button and selecting an existing IP address from the dropdown menu, or creating a new one by clicking the **plus icon** button.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add IP Addresses"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/add-ip-address-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/add-ip-address-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Device Alias and Non-Authoritative Alias

You can add multiple aliases to a device using the **+ Add New** button. Toggle on **Is Preferred** for one of the aliases. Then, you can add one or many **Device Non-Authoritative Alias** to associate nicknames with the device.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add device aliases"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-aliases-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-aliases-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

Both the device alias and non-authoritative alias add alternate names for the device. You can search for a device using its authoritative alias. However, only the preferred alias is used for device matching during an autodiscovery job.

The preferred alias will be the name that appears in device topology maps, impact charts, and dependency charts. The preferred alias is also displayed when adding a device to a business application. 

For example, a device named "0101-DEV01" has the preferred alias "0101-DEV01.gov.it". 

- The preferred alias is displayed on the topology map:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Topology with device alias"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/topology-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/topology-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- When adding a device to a business application, you can search for that device with the device name, but the preferred alias is the name that will display on the chart.

  Business Service device search:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Business Service search"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-service-search-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-service-search-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

  Business Service chart:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Business Service with device"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-service-alias-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-service-alias-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

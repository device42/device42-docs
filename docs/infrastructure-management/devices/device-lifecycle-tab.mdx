From version 19.05 of the Device42 UI onward, the **Lifecycle Tab** is only available using the device **Legacy** view. 

In the device details view, from version 19.05 and later, the following sections have been moved from the **Lifecycle Tab** to the right-hand **Breakdown** panel:
- **Asset Lifecycle**
- **Purchase/Support Info**

The **Device QR/Barcode** field is now under the **Details** section of the device details view.

  }}
/>

### Asset Lifecycle

Provide the required details of **Date**, **Time**, and lifecycle **Event** to associate a new lifecycle event with the device. Optionally add an **End User** and related **Notes** and **Tags** to the event. Tags are useful for adding additional categories to manage your devices.

Add a new lifecycle event to the device using the **+ Add New** button.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-lifecycle-tab/asset-lifecycle-event-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Some of the predefined **Events** have logic built in. For example, you cannot choose **Checked Out** on a device or asset already checked out. Similarly, you can only select **Checked In** if the device is checked out.

To add logic to asset lifecycle **Events**, go to **Tools > Lifecycle Event Actions**.

### Add a New LifeCycle Event

Define a custom lifecycle **Event** by clicking the **plus sign** button near the **Events** dropdown menu and then **Create** on the pop-up window.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-lifecycle-tab/add-custom-event-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-lifecycle-tab/add-custom-event-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Choose actions for your lifecycle event in the pop-up window. For example, when retiring a server, you can add actions like **Clear all IPs** and **Clear all Connectivity**.

The options are: 

- **Clear all IPs:** Clear any IP addresses associated with the device.
- **Clear all Connectivity:** Clear any switch port, direct device, or patch panel connections.
- **Append seconds since epoch to hostname:** Add a unique number to the hostname so that you re-use the original hostname but still have a record of the old one.
- Add custom suffix to name.
- **Append seconds since epoch to name, serial number, and uuid:** Add a unique number to the name, serial number, and UUID to re-use the original values and keep a record of the old one.
- Add custom suffix to name, serial number, and uuid.
- **Change device service level to:** For example, out of service.
- Change asset service level to
- Remove device or asset from rack
- **Add device or asset to storage room:** Select a room from the dropdown menu or click the magnifying glass icon to add a new room.
- Checkboxes for the options:
  - Change to not in service
  - Remove virtual machine from the host
  - Remove blade device from the host
  - No longer count OS or software on this device in licensing.

### Asset QR/Barcode

Add a QR code or barcode to the device for inventory management.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-lifecycle-tab/asset-qr-barcode-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

1. Assign an existing QR code or barcode profile to the device or create a new profile by clicking the plus sign.
2. You can view and print the QR code by clicking the **QR/Barcode **link.

See working with [QR asset tags](infrastructure-management/mobile-inventory/understanding-qr-and-bar-codes-in-device42.mdx) in Device42.

### Purchase/Support Info

Enter purchase information related to the device under **Purchase/Support Info**. You can add once-off purchases and record and manage contracts relating to the device.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-lifecycle-tab/purchase-support-info-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Add new **Purchase/Support Info** using the **+ Add New** button.

## Device List, Add Device, and Change Device Pages

The Device Add and Change pages provide direct access to device properties such as the device **Name** and **Asset** and **Serial** numbers. You can also set the device **Type**, which allows you to define a **physical**, **virtual**, or **cluster** device. The **Network Device** checkbox should be checked for all network hardware, the **Blade Chassis** checkbox should be checked for blade chassis devices, and the **Virtual/Container Host** box should be checked for devices that will host virtual devices. You can use **Service Level** to define a device's production status and **Hardware** to select the appropriate device hardware model.

:::note
Device42 no longer identifies previously undiscovered hardware as **unknown** by default. Autodiscovery assigns the **physical** type to devices with hardware models. The **other** type and subtypes have been reclassified as the **physical** type and subtypes.

### Devices List Page

Select **Resources > Compute > All Devices** to display a list of devices.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/devices-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/devices-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Configure the grid view to display the columns you want to see by clicking the **gear icon**. You can set the view as the **System Default** or the **User Default** using the checkboxes. 

The **Latest Life Cycle Event** is a useful column to add to the default view for tracking the status of a device.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/latest-life-cycle-column-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/latest-life-cycle-column-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### View Device Information

Click on a device's name to enter the device details view.

Version 19.05 introduces an improved device details page. If you prefer the previous layout, you can revert to the **Legacy View** layout. 

There are two new panels that you can hide and expand as needed:

- **Object List** (left): Navigate to the detail view of different devices without going back to the list page. This panel displays the same items shown in the list page grid from the previous screen. Any filters or searches made on the Devices list page are applied to this panel to navigate easily between the devices.
- **Breakdown** (right): Navigate between sections of the selected device's details. This panel is similar to the tabs of the previous layout but includes a more granular list of sections.

<ThemedImage 
  alt="Device details"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-details-view-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-details-view-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**UI Notes**
  
- Columns under the **Asset Lifecycle** subview can now be sorted in ascending or descending order.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Asset Lifecycle columns"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/asset-lifecycle-columns-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/asset-lifecycle-columns-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Discovered [**Certificate Instances**](/infrastructure-management/certificate-management.mdx) are displayed in the device details view.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Certificate Instances"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/certificate-instances-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/certificate-instances-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

### Object Category Visibility

In v19.06, the **Object Category** field is hidden when [Role-Based Access Control](/administration/role-based-access-control/#object-category-field) (RBAC) is turned off globally. A workaround on view pages is to use the **Legacy View** button to see the field.

Also, the following **Actions** on the Devices list page will be hidden when RBAC is off:

- **Set Object Category**
- **Delete Object Category**

You can enable RBAC under **Tools > Settings > Global Settings**.

### Subpage Options

Subpage buttons are now displayed in the device details view. Devices with conditional subpages, like Switch Ports and Power Consumption, are also displayed in this row of subpage buttons. Typical subpages include:
  
  - Info (basic device details)
  - Application Group Calculation
  - Layout
  - Impact Chart
  - Topology
  - Impact List
  - Audit Logs

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Subpage buttons"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/subpage-buttons-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/subpage-buttons-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

### Add a Device

Select **Resources > Compute > All Devices** and then click **Create** in the upper-right corner. You will see the generic form with the **Type** shown as blank.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Create button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/create-device-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/create-device-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

By default, new devices are assigned the **In Service** property and their **Service Level** is set to **Production**.

Enter a **Name** for the device and select **physical**, **virtual**, or **cluster** for the device **Type**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device Types"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-type-options-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-type-options-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The available options and fields on the Add Device page differ according to the device **Type** selected:

- For physical devices, you can select or add a **Physical Subtype**.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Physical Subtypes"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/physical-subtype-options-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/physical-subtype-options-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- For virtual devices, you can select a **Virtual Subtype**.

    <ThemedImage
      alt="Virtual Subtypes"
      sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/virtual-subtype-options-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/virtual-subtype-options-dark.png'),
      }}
    />

- The cluster devices, the page displays an **Available Devices in Cluster** list.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Clusters"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/devices-in-cluster-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/devices-in-cluster-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

:::note
For dropdown menus that include related lookups – for example, when you select **Physical** and the **Physical Subtype** dropdown appears – you'll see the **+** (plus sign) button. However, if your account lacks the necessary permissions, you won’t be able to create new records.
:::

## Basic Device Addition and Editing

Select **Devices > All Devices** to display a list of devices.

Click on a device **Name** to see the details for that device, and then click **Edit** in the top right of the View page.

Consider the following example of a network switch:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Edit Device"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/edit-device-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/edit-device-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- The highlighted checkboxes above indicate whether the device is a **Network Device**, **Blade Chassis**, or **Virtual/Container Host**. 
  <!-- Keep the two-line spacing for Docusaurus to render the sub-paragraphs on a new line. -->
  
  **It is important to choose the correct attributes**: You can only add switch ports to devices with the **Network Device** option checked. Similarly, blades can only be added to a **Blade Chassis**, and only a **Virtual/Container Host** can have guests.
- You can edit the **Service Level** status.


  If you have a server that is in procurement or awaiting installation, you can select the **In Procurement** option from the **Service Level** dropdown to reserve rack space for the device after procurement.
- The **Serial #** and **Asset #** fields are displayed for physical and blade devices.

### Non-Editable Fields 

Fields populated through EnrichAI Data, like **End of Life** and **End of Support**, are not editable. To set these fields, you need to [disable EnrichAI Data](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/enrichai-opt-out.mdx) and disconnect the record from the EnrichAI Data record.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Non-editable fields"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/non-editable-fields-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/non-editable-fields-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Warning: Changing a Device Type

It is possible to change a device type, for example, from **physical** to **virtual**, **cluster**, or **unknown**. Please be aware that when you change a device type, you will lose all the attributes specific to that device type.

Device42 presents an alert with potential change conflicts when a user alters a device type.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change conflict warning"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/change-conflict-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/change-conflict-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

When you change from a physical device type, you lose the following:

- The rack, room, or storage room information
- The hardware model
- Any IP or power connectivity
- The blade chassis property
- All blade information

When you change from a virtual device type, you lose the following:

- The virtual host property
- Any cloud instance data

When you change from a blade device type, you lose the following:

- The blade host information
- The blade chassis slot number
- The hardware model
- The storage room information
- Any IP or power connectivity

When you change from a cluster device type, you lose all cluster associations.

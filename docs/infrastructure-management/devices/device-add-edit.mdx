## Device List, Add Device, and Change Device Pages

The Device Add and Change pages provide direct access to device properties such as the device **Name** and **Asset** and **Serial** numbers. You can also set the device **Type**, which allows you to define a **physical**, **virtual**, or **cluster** device. The **Network Device** checkbox should be checked for all network hardware, the **Blade Chassis** checkbox should be checked for blade chassis devices, and the **Virtual/Container Host** box should be checked for devices that will host virtual devices. You can use **Service Level** to define a device's production status and **Hardware** to select the appropriate device hardware model.

:::note
Device42 no longer identifies previously undiscovered hardware as **unknown** by default. Autodiscovery assigns the **physical** type to devices with hardware models. The **other** type and subtypes have been reclassified as the **physical** type and subtypes.

### Devices List Page

Select **Resources > Compute > All Devices** to display a list of devices.

<ThemedImage
  alt="All devices button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/devices-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/devices-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Configure the grid view to display the columns you want to see by clicking the **gear icon**. You can set the view as **System Default** and/or **User Default** using the checkboxes. 

The **Latest Life Cycle Event** is a useful column to add to the default view to track the status of a device.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/latest-life-cycle-column-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/latest-life-cycle-column-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### View Device Details

Click on a device **Name** to view the device details. The details are organized into sections (that were tabs in versions prior to v19.05) and navigable using the **Breakdown** panel.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device details"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-details-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-details-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Add a Device

Select **Resources > Compute > All Devices** and then click **Add Device** in the upper-right corner.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add devices button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/add-device-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/add-device-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

When you select **Add Device**, you will see the generic Add Device page with the **Type** shown as blank. By default, new devices are assigned the **In Service** property and their **Service Level** is set to **Production**.

Enter a **Name** for the device and select **physical**, **virtual**, or **cluster** for the device **Type**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device Types"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-types-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/device-types-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The available options and fields on the Add Device page differ according to the device **Type** selected:

- For physical devices, you can select or add a **Physical Subtype**.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Physical Subtypes"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/physical-subtypes-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/physical-subtypes-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- For virtual devices, you can select a **Virtual Subtype**.

    <ThemedImage
      alt="Virtual Subtypes"
      sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/virtual-subtypes-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/virtual-subtypes-dark.png'),
      }}
    />

- The cluster devices, the page displays an **Available Devices in Cluster** list.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Clusters"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/cluster-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/cluster-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

Enter or select the options you want for the device, then **Save** the device and add it to the appropriate device list.

## Basic Device Addition and Editing

Select **Devices > All Devices** to display a list of devices.

Click on a device **Name** to see the details for that device, and then click **Edit** in the top right of the View page.

Consider the following example of a network switch:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Edit Device"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/edit-device-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/edit-device-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- The highlighted checkboxes above indicate whether the device is a **Network Device**, **Blade Chassis**, or **Virtual/Container Host**. 
  <!-- Keep the two-line spacing for Docusaurus to render the sub-paragraphs on a new line. -->
  
  **It is important to choose the correct attributes**: You can only add switch ports to devices with the **Network Device** option checked. Similarly, blades can only be added to a **Blade Chassis**, and only a **Virtual/Container Host** can have guests.
- You can edit the **Service Level** status.


  If you have a server that is in procurement or awaiting installation, you can select the **In Procurement** option from the **Service Level** dropdown to reserve rack space for the device after procurement.
- The **Serial #** and **Asset #** fields are displayed for physical and blade devices.

### Non-Editable Fields 

Fields populated through EnrichAI Data, like **OS Version** or OS **End of Life**, are not editable. To set these fields, you need to [disable EnrichAI Data](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/enrichai-opt-out.mdx) and disconnect the record from the EnrichAI Data record.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/non-editable-fields-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Warning: Changing a Device Type

It is possible to change a device type, for example, from **physical** to **virtual**, **cluster**, or **unknown**. Please be aware that when you change a device type, you will lose all the attributes specific to that device type.

Device42 presents an alert with potential change conflicts when a user alters a device type.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change conflict warning"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/change-conflict-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-add-edit/change-conflict-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

When you change from a physical device type, you lose the following:

- The rack, room, or storage room information
- The hardware model
- Any IP or power connectivity
- The blade chassis property
- All blade information

When you change from a virtual device type, you lose the following:

- The virtual host property
- Any cloud instance data

When you change from a blade device type, you lose the following:

- The blade host information
- The blade chassis slot number
- The hardware model
- The storage room information
- Any IP or power connectivity

When you change from a cluster device type, you lose all cluster associations.

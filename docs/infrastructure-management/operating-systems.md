Device42 tracks which devices are running which Operating Systems (OS). This module also ties into Software License Management so that you can see how many copies you are licensed for and how many you are actually using.

Navigate to **Resources > Operating Systems > All Operating Systems** to locate the Operating Systems list.

If the OS is standardized and enriched by the EnrichAI Cloud Service, a blue AI icon will be displayed to the right of its name (under the **Name** column). 

The Operating Systems list page shows all of your operating systems and includes the **Total Count** of devices running the OS, the **Discovered Licensed Count**, and the number of OSs that are not licensed (named **Discovered Non-Licensed Count**). If you click on one of the listed operating systems, you will see details including which machines are running the OS.

## EnrichAI Operating System Fields

If the operating system record has been enriched, key maintenance dates may be displayed in the **Enriched Data** section along with other OS details.

See the [Operating System Attributes](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.md#operating-system-attributes) and [Key Support Dates](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.md#key-support-dates) sections of the [EnrichAI Data](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/#operating-system-attributes) page for the list of fields that can be populated through EnrichAI.

Note that data will only be populated by EnrichAI if it's used by the OS vendor and if the data is available.

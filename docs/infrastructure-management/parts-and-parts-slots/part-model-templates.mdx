Device42 supports parts having ports, parts slots, and more. If you are looking for information about [adding parts slots (and/or blade slots) to devices has its own section.](../devices/device-parts-slots.mdx)

## Part Model Templates

**Part Models** are templates that define parts. You can create parts templates that optionally include ports.

Navigate to **DataCenter > Parts > Model list** and click **Create** in the upper right:

<ThemedImage
alt="Add a parts model button"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/create-parts-model-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/create-parts-model-dark.png'),
}}
/>

From this screen you can add a new parts model:

<ThemedImage
alt="Add a parts model screen"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/add-parts-model-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/add-parts-model-page-dark.png'),
}}
/>

You can add a new part type classification if the type of part you are adding doesn't already exist. Do this by clicking the **plus sign icon** (+) next to **Type**.

<ThemedImage
alt="Add new part sub-type"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/add-parts-type-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/add-parts-type-dark.png'),
}}
/>

**The Supports Ports Checkbox**

While creating a part type, select the **Supports Ports** checkbox if you'd like to define ports and a port layout. You may set the **Supports Ports** flag while creating a new part, or modifying a part.

:::note
You will not find the supports ports option on parts designated ‘disk drives’ or ‘physical memory’
:::

Parts (with or without ports), once defined, may optionally be placed into “parts slots”. Or, if desired, a parts slot also may simply be left empty.


### Port Templates

A port template may include a name prefix, a name template that configures the port naming scheme, and a port type. Ports may also be added in bulk, automatically named based on information configured in the template.

You may now elect to **auto-create ports** during creation of a new device. If the **Add Ports When Creating Device** checkbox is checked on the chosen hardware model template, the new device will be created with all its model-defined ports. Following a discovery run, Device42 will add discovered connections to these ports automatically.

### Edit Part Model Templates

Edit any existing by simply viewing it and choosing the **Edit** button in the upper right hand corner:

<ThemedImage
alt="Edit ports layout button on a part template"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/edit-parts-model-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/part-model-templates/edit-parts-model-dark.png'),
}}
/>

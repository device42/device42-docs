This document explains how to import part models using API Imports. For a detailed explanation of part models and parts, see the [Part Model Templates](infrastructure-management/parts-and-parts-slots/part-model-templates.mdx).

## Data Example

The sample data in the spreadsheet below is our starting point for this import. This data was exported from a legacy system into CSV format.

![Sample parts data spreadsheet](/assets/images/importing-part-models/sample-parts-data.png)

## Download Sample Spreadsheet

Navigate to **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)**, find **Part Models - Create/Update Part Models**, and click **Download Sample Excel File**. Open the sample file to begin the import process.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/download-sample-spreadsheet-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/download-sample-spreadsheet-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Understanding Column Comments

Hover over the upper-right corner of the heading cell in each column to see details about the field. These tooltips indicate whether fields are required, optional, or provide additional context.

The spreadsheet includes additional part model type parameters specific to CPU, RAM, and hard disk components. The `type` field is required for all part models.

## Populating the Sample Sheet

Update the sample spreadsheet with your part model data from the CSV export. Since these are new part models, only the `type` field is required. You can delete unused parameters from the sheet or leave them blank.

Notice the additional parameters that have been added for CPU and RAM models. 

## Choose File and Import

Navigate to **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)**, browse to your populated file, and select **Import** to begin the import process.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/choose-file-import-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/choose-file-import-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Import Results

Device42 displays the status of the import. If there are any issues, the results will show "The following were not added..." with specific error details. Review the results carefully, as any problems (such as missing required parameters) are usually clearly stated.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/import-results-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Verifying Imported Parts Models

Navigate to **Datacenter > Parts > Model List** to view all the parts models that were imported in the previous step.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/parts-model-list-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/parts-model-list-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

To validate the import, examine a few of the imported items:

**Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Model:**

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/hdd-part-model-detail-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**RAM Module Model:**

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/ram-part-model-detail-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/ram-part-model-detail-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**Patch Cable Model:**

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/patch-cable-part-model-detail-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-part-models/patch-cable-part-model-detail-dark.png'),
  }}

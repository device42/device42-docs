This document explains how to import parts using the Spreadsheets Import tool found under **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)**.

## Importing Part Models vs. Importing Parts

Please see [Managing Spare Parts](infrastructure-management/parts-and-parts-slots/part-model-templates.mdx) for an explanation of part models vs. parts in Device42.

Both parts and part models can be created using the **Parts - Create/Update Parts** import, whereas the **Part Models - Create/Update Part Models** import only creates models.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/part-models-vs-parts-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/part-models-vs-parts-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Download Current Data

This document demonstrates how to add parts to existing part models, building on the imported models covered in the [Importing Part Models document](infrastructure-management/parts-and-parts-slots/importing-part-models.mdx).

Go to **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)** and download the current data for spare part models as highlighted below.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Download current parts data"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/part-models-export-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/part-models-export-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

A current data export sheet is shown below. Creating parts from existing part models requires the part model ID. Keep this sheet open.

## Download Sample File

Next, download the **Create or update spare parts** sample sheet by going to **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Sample download"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/sample-download-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/sample-download-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Use the data from the current data export to help populate the parts import.

## Populate the Sample Sheet

Add a column for `partmodel_id` and populate the sample spreadsheet to add new parts to two of the existing part models you created. Add the serial numbers manually or using a laser handheld scanner (see below).

This import creates the following:

- For `partmodel_id` `211` (name `3.5" 2TB Dell Drives`): Four line items with assignments and serial numbers (unique line items are required to track serial numbers)

- For `partmodel_id` `219` (name `4GB PC3 8500R`): Two line items with assignments (since you don't need to track serial numbers for these items, you are only tracking room assignment and count)

Save the file and import it.

## Handheld Scanner

You can use a DBPOWER scanner purchased on Amazon, which works well for this purpose. It comes with a USB receiver and can be programmed to automatically go to the next row in Excel, making it very quick and easy to capture serial numbers or other bar codes.

## Import Results

Go to **Tools > Imports/Exports (.xls)**, choose your file, and click **Import**. The results of the import are shown below.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/import-results-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/import-results-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Let's look at these new parts in the UI.

The new parts appear on separate line items, as these are the unique line items needed for tracking serial numbers.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Parts list showing imported serial numbered parts"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/parts-list-serial-numbers-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/parts-list-serial-numbers-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The new parts appear on two lines. Since you're not tracking serial numbers, you only need two lines to track the room assignments for these RAM modules.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-parts/parts-list-room-assignments-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

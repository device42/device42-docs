To get a list of your racks, go to **Infrastructure > DataCenter > Racks** to display the Racks list page. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Racks list page with Actions menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/racks-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/racks-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Like the list view pages for other objects, you'll see your racks and several sortable columns of information. Use the available filters and search box to narrow down the list of racks displayed.

Get a quick look of where space is available in the racks with the **Available Us** column that displays the availability heatmap of each rack.

You can select one or more racks and to activate the **Actions** dropdown. For example, use the **Show Front Layout of selected racks** action to see a view showing the layouts of each selected rack. From that layout view, you drag and drop devices from one rack to another (more on this below).

Add a new rack by clicking the **Create** button from the Racks list page and fill in the details outlined below. 

## Rack Details Overview

Provide the details for the new rack or edit an existing rack by selecting the existing rack from the list page and clicking **Edit**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rack edit mode"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The **Details** section includes the following fields:

- **Size**: Size of rack in U's. The standard and default is **42**.
- **Numbering start from bottom**: By default, slot **1** is at the bottom of the rack in the visual layout. Turn off this option if you prefer numbering from the top in the visual layout of the rack.
- **First number**: By default, rack numbering starts at one but you can change it here to customize the rack numbering (for example, you might want the first number to be **0**).
- **Number between U's**: By default, the visual rack layout will display U numbers between Us. Turn off this option to display U numbers at the Us.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Rack edit mode"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-2-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-2-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }} 
    />

- **Row**: If you have a name for the row, put it here. Please note that the row name is for information only and will not affect the layout of the room. In the visual room layout, rows are initially created automatically and will not use this setting. You can then drag and drop racks to create rows. If all racks in a given row in the visual layout have the same Row value, the value will appear to the left of the row. The same applies to columns in the visual layout â€“ if all the racks in a given column have the same Row value, the value will appear at the top of the column.
- **Room**: Choose the room for the rack. You can click the **+** (plus sign icon) to create a new room from this page.
- **Manufacturer**: Select the rack manufacturer.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Rack edit mode"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-3-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-3-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }} 
    />

- **Tags**: Tags are used to categorize racks for convenient searching.
- **Notes**: Store any additional notes here.
- **QR Code**: If you have a QR code for rack for asset tracking, you can add it here. 

### Add Devices to the Rack

You can easily add devices, assets, and PDUs to the rack right from the rack edit page. Click **+ Add More** and next to the empty Device field, click the **+** (plus sign) lookup indicator and search and filter the listing of physical devices to find the device you want to add.

There are three other ways to add devices, assets, and PDUs to racks:

1. From the device, asset, or PDU edit pages
2. Under [**Tools > Import/Export (xls)**](/integration/imports/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports), using Excel spreadsheets to add devices, assets, and PDUs to racks.
3. [Using APIs](https://api.device42.com)
4. From the rack layout screen. See the [Visually adding assets to the layout screen section](#visually-adding-assets-to-the-rack-from-the-rack-layout-screen) below.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rack devices fields"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Devices must have a [Hardware Model](/infrastructure-management/devices/hardware-models-templates/) with a defined size to give them the **Rack Mounted** designation under the **Where** field. You can add devices to the Left, Right, Top, or Bottom without a hardware model.

- **Start at**: Starting U location for the device. 
- **Orientation**: Choose the orientation of the mounted device here. Device depth is determined by the hardware model properties.
  
The **Find next slot** option pictured below automatically finds an available space in the rack based on the device U size.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Rack devices fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-2-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-2-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }} 
    />

### Visually adding devices to the rack from the rack layout screen

Click **Rack Layout** from the view screen of the rack and turn on edit mode on the left sidebar. Under **Add Device**, you can search for devices by name or use the **+** (plus sign) lookup indicator to add a new device.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/layout-add-device-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/layout-add-device-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Drag and drop the device from the sidebar onto the rack layout.

### Rack Unit Numbering Layout Options

By default, the option to display rack unit **Numbers between the U's** is toggle on when creating a new rack. To display the rack unit numbers at the U's, turn off this option.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Number between U's option in Rack view"
  sources={{

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/global-settings-racks-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Adding assets to the rack from the rack edit screen

Assets could be your patch panels, filler panels, and fans that take U space or power in the rack. You can add assets to racks from the rack edit page or associate assets to racks via the Assets list page under **Resources > Assets**.

Asset sizes are in U units and include one decimal place.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Adding assets to the rack from the rack edit screen"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/add-rack-assets-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/add-rack-assets-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can choose and existing asset or add a new asset using the lookup button. Provide the size and starting location of the asset, along with its depth and orientation.

Unlike devices, assets can have the same names and even blank names are allowed (but not recommended). 

### Visually adding assets to the rack from the rack layout screen

Click **Rack Layout** from the view screen of the rack and turn on edit mode on the left sidebar. Under **Add New Asset**, choose the asset type and provide the size, depth, and location of the asset. You can add new asset types when creating a new asset under **Resources > All Assets**.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/clone-action-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/clone-action-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '60%' }} 
/>

You can choose the room where the cloned racks go, choose a device naming profile, a prefix for rack and PDU names and some other optional fields as shown below.

Note: The **Rack name prefix** will be prepended to each rack name. The **Rack name prefix to ignore** will be removed from the rack name.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Clone selection field options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/clone-fields-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/clone-fields-dark.png'),

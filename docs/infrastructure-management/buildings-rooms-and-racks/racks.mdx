To get a list of your racks, go to **Infrastructure > DataCenter > Racks** to display the Racks list page. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Racks list page with Actions menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/racks-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/racks-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Like the list view pages for other objects, you'll see your racks and several sortable columns of information. Use the available filters and search box to narrow down the list of racks displayed.

Get a quick look of where space is available in the racks with the **Available Us** column that displays the availability heatmap of each rack.

You can select one or more racks and to activate the **Actions** dropdown. For example, use the **Show Front Layout of selected racks** action to see a view showing the layouts of each selected rack. From that layout view, you drag and drop devices from one rack to another (more on this below).

## Rack Details Edit Overview

Click on one of the rack names to see all the details about the rack. From this details view, you can make changes to the rack by clicking **Edit**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rack edit mode"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The **Details** section includes the following fields:

- **Size**: Size of rack in U's. The standard and default is **42**.
- **Numbering start from bottom**: By default, slot **1** is at the bottom of the rack in the visual layout. Turn off this option if you prefer numbering from the top in the visual layout of the rack.
- **First number**: By default, rack numbering starts at one but you can change it here to customize the rack numbering (for example, you might want the first number to be **0**).
- **Number between U's**: By default, the visual rack layout will display U numbers between Us. Turn off this option to display U numbers at the Us.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Rack edit mode"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-2-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-2-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }} 
    />

- **Row**: If you have a name for the row, put it here. Please note that the row name is for information only and will not affect the layout of the room. In the visual room layout, rows are initially created automatically and will not use this setting. You can then drag and drop racks to create rows. If all racks in a given row in the visual layout have the same Row value, the value will appear to the left of the row. The same applies to columns in the visual layout – if all the racks in a given column have the same Row value, the value will appear at the top of the column.
- **Room**: Choose the room for the rack. You can click the **+** (plus sign icon) to create a new room from this page.
- **Manufacturer**: Select the rack manufacturer.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Rack edit mode"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-3-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/edit-rack-3-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }} 
    />

- **Tags**: Tags are used to categorize racks for convenient searching.
- **Notes**: Store any additional notes here.
- **QR Code**: If you have a QR code for rack for asset tracking, you can add it here.

### Add Devices to the Rack

You can easily add devices, assets, and PDUs to the rack right from the rack edit page. Click **+ Add More** and next to the empty Device field, click the **+** (plus sign) lookup indicator and search and filter the listing of physical devices to find the device you want to add.

There are three other ways to add devices, assets, and PDUs to racks:

1. From the device, asset, or PDU edit pages
2. Under [**Tools > Import/Export (xls)**](/integration/imports/spreadsheet-imports-and-exports), using Excel spreadsheets to add devices, assets, and PDUs to racks.
3. [Using APIs](https://api.device42.com)
4. From the rack layout screen. See the [Visually adding assets to the layout screen section](#visually-adding-assets-to-the-rack-from-the-rack-layout-screen) below.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rack devices fields"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Devices must have a [Hardware Model](/infrastructure-management/devices/hardware-models-templates/) with a defined size to give them the **Rack Mounted** designation under the **Where** field. You can add devices to the Left, Right, Top, or Bottom without a hardware model.

- **Start at**: Starting U location for the device. 
- **Orientation**: Choose the orientation of the mounted device here. Device depth is determined by the hardware model properties.
  
The **Find next slot** option pictured below automatically finds an available space in the rack based on the device U size.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Rack devices fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-2-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/racks/rack-devices-2-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }} 
    />

### Visually adding devices to the rack from the rack layout screen

From the rack layout screen, you will see the option to add a device:

![Visually adding devices to the rack from the rack layout screen](/assets/images/2015-10-10-add-device-to-rack.png)

Choose a hardware model and a template object will appear. Drag the template object to a rack slot and the popup shown above will appear. Fill in at least the rack name and the move is complete.

### Rack Unit Numbering Layout Options

![Rack Unit Numbering Layout Options](/assets/images/wpid6456-rack-unit-options.png)

Displaying rack unit numbers between the U's is the default setting - pictured above (top) - unselecting "Number between U's" will display the rack unit numbers at the U's.

When displaying between the U's, there are two options. Pictured above (bottom) - the "Rack Number Between U's Option" is located in the Global Settings Menu (Tools >> Settings >> Global Settings).

The options:

- Start At - pictured below (left) displays the starting U number between the U's.
- End At - pictured below (right) displays the ending U number between the U's.

### Adding assets to the rack from the rack edit screen

![Adding assets to the rack from the rack edit screen](/assets/images/wpid6433-Adding_assets_to_the_rack.png)

Assets could be your patch panels, filler panels, fans etc. that take U space and/or power in the rack. These can be added from the rack edit page or from the Assets menu.

You can add a new asset (or choose an existing asset) using the lookup button, add the size and starting location. (along with depth and orientation)

Unlike devices, assets can have the same names and even blank names are allowed (but not recommended). The following is a quick video showing how to easily add assets to the rack.

### Visually adding assets to the rack from the rack layout screen

![Visually adding assets to the rack from the rack layout screen](/assets/images/wpid6434-AssetTemplates.png)

Asset templates can be dragged and dropped into racks as illustrated above. However, first you must create asset templates. You can do this in Devices > Assets > Racked Asset Templates. Once you add the racked asset template, you can just drag and drop the template from the sidebar to the rack position where you need it to be.

### Add new asset template from the rack layout

![Add new asset template from the rack layout](/assets/images/wpid6445-media_1424466227206.png)

### Rack elevations physical connections with drag and drop

![Rack elevations physical connections with drag and drop](/assets/images/wpid6444-media_1424466162974.png)

From the rack layout page, you can go to Physical connections and visualize power and network connectivity from this page. You can optionally turn off either of the connections to see only power or only network cables. Also, in the edit mode, drag and drop is now available for PDU ports and network ports (from/to patch panel ports or switch ports).

![](/assets/images/wpid6447-media_1424515989100.png)

When you view the physical connections, you will see outlets that resemble the outlet receptacle type. Examples of the receptacle types are show below.

![](/assets/images/wpid6448-media_1424516011534.png)

### Selected/highlighted paths and port label display in physical connectivity layouts

![Selected/highlighted paths and port label display in physical connectivity layouts](/assets/images/wpid6452-media_1424517266968.png)

In the physical connection layout, you can select a port for a device and the display will highlight the path.

### Adding PDUs to the rack

- You can add PDUs in and around the rack, details for adding and displaying PDUs is discussed in detailed in the PDU section at: [PDU Rack Display](infrastructure-management/power-units/pdu-rack-display.mdx)

### Bulk operations

![Bulk operations](/assets/images/wpid6435-media_1362134989530.png)

From the Racks view, you can select one, several, or all racks and apply a number of bulk operations:

Delete: Delete the selected racks

Show Front Layout: Show the visual layout (front view) of all the selected racks

Show Back Layout: Show the visual layout (back view) of all the selected racks

Change orientation to left: Change the orientation of the selected racks in the visual layout to left-pointing racks

Change orientation to right: Change the orientation of the selected racks in the visual layout to right-pointing racks

Put U numbers between U's: In the visual layout of the selected racks, place the U numbers between the U's

Put U numbers at U's: In the visual layout of the selected racks, place the U numbers at the U's

### Visualize multiple racks together

![Visualize multiple racks together](/assets/images/wpid6437-media_1414075593772.png)

As mentioned in the bulk operations in the step above, you can select multiple racks, choose "show front (or back) layout of selected racks" and see multiple racks together.

### Moving devices between racks

![Moving devices between racks](/assets/images/wpid6438-media_1414075696026.png)

You can also drag and drop devices between racks. On a tablet, this can be done with a swipe of the finger.

When you drag a device from one rack to another, the power and network connections to the device be removed and you will be prompted to select what PDU ports you want to connect the device to.

![Transfer PDU Connections](/assets/images/2015-10-10-rack-drag.png)

You can choose 1 or more ports per PDU.

### Clone select racks

![Clone select racks](/assets/images/wpid6450-media_1424517172751.png)

Using the action drop down on the rack page, you can choose the “Clone selected racks” action and it will clone the selected racks as well as the PDUs and the devices in those racks. Device to PDU outlet connections are also cloned. You can choose the room where the cloned racks go, choose a device naming profile, a prefix for rack and PDU names and some other optional fields as shown below.

![](/assets/images/wpid6451-media_1424517217056.png)

Note: The Rack name prefix will be prepended to each rack name. The Rack name prefix to ignore will be removed from the rack name.

### Audit reports from racks

![Audit reports from racks](/assets/images/wpid6440-media_1414445113486.png)

Looking to audit your racks in a jiffy? Download the ready to go Audit excel file for selected racks and inventory/audit all assets like PDUs, devices and assets in the rack.

The export sheet is sorted by rack name and includes PDUs on the side and then devices, PDUs and assets from top to bottom in the rack. With this sheet, you can use a handheld wireless scanner to read the asset #s(from barcode labels) to the sheet and quickly verify the correctness of your inventory.

**Note:** The start\_col=1, start\_row=1 refers to the upper left cell regarding of the row numbering scheme. 2, 2 refers to the 2nd row, 2nd column. 3.5, 3.5 refers to a rack that is position between the 3rd and 4th cells both vertically and horizontally. Effectively this means that the start\_row, start\_col will correspond with the room "Grid and Numbering" scheme only if numbers are used and vertical and horizontal are both set to 1.

 

### Visualizing PDU Connections

![Visualizing PDU Connections](/assets/images/wpid6441-media_1414490904015.png)

You can now visualize PDU connections by clicking the PDU Map button. Quickly see what is connected where with respect to power and visualize dual or single connected servers from the rack level. You can zoom-in and zoom-out using the mouse wheel and drag the layout around.

### What-If Simulation

To do what-if simulations, navigate to Tools >> Templates and Bulk Operations >> What If...

![Visualizing PDU Connections](/assets/images/2015-10-10-what-if-1.png)

Here you can enter device and power information for devices that need to be racked and choose a simulation based on racks in a building, room, or chosen from a list. When you click What If, you will see a list of simulated results...

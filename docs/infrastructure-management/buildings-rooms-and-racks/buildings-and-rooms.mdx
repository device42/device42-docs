### Associate Assets to a Room

- You can associate assets with server rooms from the Main Appliance or via the API (see the [Rooms API doc](https://api.device42.com/#Rooms_postAssetsRoom)). 

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Room with assets"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/room-with-assets-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/room-with-assets-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- The association is bi-directional; the asset is visible in the room details and the room is visible in the asset details. 

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Asset with room association"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/server-room-info-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/server-room-info-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- The assets associated with a room are visible in the room layout view. However, you cannot add assets to a room from the layout view.
  
  <ThemedImage

    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/layout-asset-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/layout-asset-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '70%' }} 
  />

## Room Layout View

Access a **Room Layout** view from a room's detailed view or using the **Show** link next to the room name on the **Rooms** list page. 

Use the zoom slider to increase or decrease the display size of the layout. Switch editing mode to on by clicking **Turn ON** in the sidebar. Only users with the necessary permissions can edit a room layout.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/room-layout-general-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Room Layout Editing

The room layout represents a room and its objects.

You can change the shape and size of the room layout.

Add or remove rows and columns using the **plus** and **minus** buttons located on the left panel.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change room size controls"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/change-room-size-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/change-room-size-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '30%' }}
/>

You can change the default row and column labeling sequence. Choose between numerical or alphabetical labeling and set the value to start with.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Grid and row numbering options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/grid-numbering-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/grid-numbering-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '40%' }}
/>

### Object Layout Editing

You can add racks and objects to the layout, move them around, resize and rotate them.

- Add object templates by dragging them from the left panel onto the layout.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Drag room object template to layout"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/room-object-templates-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/room-object-templates-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
/>

- Increase the size of an object by dragging its vertical or horizontal edge. Objects can occupy multiple grid spaces or as little as 1/10 of a grid cell.

    Deselect the **Show details on hover** checkbox on the left panel when resizing objects to prevent popups from obscuring your view. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Resizing objects"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/object-resizing-light.gif'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/object-resizing-dark.gif'),
  }}
/>

- Rotate objects by 90 or 180 degrees by hovering over the object and clicking the rotate buttons located on the popup panel.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rotating objects"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/rotate-buttons-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/rotate-buttons-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- You can reposition and rotate multiple objects at once. Select multiple objects by dragging your cursor over them. Reposition multiple selected objects by dragging them. Rotate multiple selected objects using the rotate buttons in the popup.

### Adding Objects to a Layout

Ensure that editing mode is enabled. Navigate to **Infrastructure > DataCenter > Rooms**, click the **Show** link under the **Layout** column, and select **Turn ON** from the layout view.

You can add any asset type to the room and are not confined to the template objects available in the left panel as shown above. You can even create your own asset types.

Racks and other objects can be added via the API or from the **Tools > Imports/Exports** menu.

### Mouse-Over Options

If you hover over an object, you will see a popup with detailed information about the object.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Object details"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/detail-panel-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/detail-panel-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
/>

For racks, you'll see the following information:

- **Name**
- **Size**
- **Vendor**
- **Available (Us)**
- **Number of Devices**
- **Total Power Ports** The total number of ports for all PDUs in the rack.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/view-connections-option-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '80%' }}
    />

### Heatmaps and Temperature Shading

You can set the object colors to denote usage or temperature information. Choose between the **Usage Heatmap** and **Temperature Heatmap** options under the **Rack color** menu. The legend on the right changes accordingly.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Rack color options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/rack-color-options-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/rack-color-options-dark.png'),
  }}
/>



In addition, you can choose to **Show temperature bubbles** or turn it off.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Display heatmap bubbles"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/heatmap-bubbles-option.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/heatmap-bubbles-option.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '60%' }}
/>

These options are saved in cookies, so you don't have to reselect the combination of options that works best for you when revisiting the page.

**Usage Heatmap Legend**

Each rack is color-coded to show the availability of U slots in the rack. Five color codes are available, ranging from green (high availability) to red (low availability). You can change the availability percentage for each color by going to **Tools > Settings > Global Settings**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Usage heatmap legend"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/usage-heatmap-legend-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/usage-heatmap-legend-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '35%' }}
/>

**Temperature Heatmap Legend**

In rooms that have temperature information, halo temperature shading around racks provides a quick view of the room’s environment.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Temperature Heatmap legend"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/temperature-heatmap-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/temperature-heatmap-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '30%' }}
/>

The color value is based on the maximum temperature of the rack and corresponds to the following temperatures:

- **Green:** \<\= 75°F (23.88°C)
- **Yellow:** Between > 75°F (23.88°C) and \<\= 90°F (32.22°C)
- **Red:** > 90°F (32.22°C)

You can update the high and moderate temperature values from the Racks section under **Tools > Settings > Global Settings**. The room rack view will update accordingly.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Global settings for temperature"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/racks-global-settings-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/buildings-and-rooms/racks-global-settings-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### PDU Power Monitoring

If you have the Power Monitoring option, you will see a rectangular bar for each input of every PDU in the rack. These bars are color-coded for power usage and represent the amount of power currently in use divided by the power capacity of the input. Green is high, and red is low. You can change the percentages in **Tools > Settings > Global Settings**.

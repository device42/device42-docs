The Device42 Software License Management (SLM) module enables the easy creation and management of software licensing models by automatically scanning Windows and Linux machine instances for software; whether running or not. The SLM module can compare counts of running instances against purchased or licensed counts and detect prohibited software without any need for agents. There is absolutely no need to install software agents on each machine that you require monitoring on!

## Software License Models

The flexible Device42 license models enables you to track any type of licensing you use. Navigate to **Resources > Software License Models** and click **+ Add Software Licensing Model**.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-software-licensing-model-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-software-licensing-model-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
/>

The **Track By** field enables you to specify whether the licenses should be tracked by **User**, **Device**, **Client Access** (CALs), or **Device CPU/Core**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By dropdown"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

### Tracking By User

If you choose to track by **User**, you will see the options:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By User"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-user-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-user-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

The **License Type** field lets you specify whether this is a **Perpetual** license or a **Subscription**. This is just a documentation field and doesn’t affect how Device42 counts the instances it finds of the software components.

The **Count Users by** field enables you to specify the purchase method. This is also just a documentation field and doesn’t affect how Device42 counts the instances it finds of the software components.

The checkbox options do the following when enabled:

- **Is Node Locked:** Specifies that each licensed instance of the software is restricted to a specific device.
- **Is User Locked:** Specifies that each licensed instance of the software is restricted to a specific user.
- **Is free:** Indicates free software.
- **Is Concurrent Access:** Specifies licensing is by the concurrent user and not by the total number of users that have access to the system.
- **Count Major Version Separately:** Specifies each major version of the software should be counted separately.

### Tracking By CALs

If you choose to track by **Client Access** licenses, you will see the options below and that the options are the same as those for tracking by user, except for the addition of the **Count CAL by** field.

The **Count CAL by** field specifies how the licenses should be counted; that is, counted on a **Per Seat - Device** basis, **Per Seat - User** basis, or on a per **Server**, **Processor**, or **Mailbox** basis.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Count CAL"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/count-cal-by-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/count-cal-by-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

### Tracking By Device

With the **Device** track by option, you see the **Count Devices by** field. This field is used solely for documentation and has five options: 
- **Volume**
- **Volume with a multiplier**
- **Single**
- **Unlimited**
- **OEM**

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By User"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/device-count-by-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/device-count-by-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

### Tracking By Device CPU

If you choose **Device CPU/Core** track by option, you will see four additional fields:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Track By Device CPU/Core option"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-device-cpu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/track-by-device-cpu-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '45%' }} 
/>

The **Count Devices by** field has five choices as listed above.

The **CPU core factor field** is for the core factor rating used by some software manufacturers.

The **CPU Count** field defines how CPUs are counted: **Total sockets** or **Total # of cores**.

The **CPU count virtual** field defines how software found on virtual machines is counted:
- **Total # of cores on host** 
- **Total sockets on host**
- **Total # of cores on VM**
- **Total sockets on VM**

## Alerts and Notifications

Set up software alerts by navigating to **Analytics > Setup Alerts** and selecting **Software** as the **Rule Type**. You can view the alerts that were triggered under **Analytics > Notifications**.

See [**Software Licensing Alerts and Notifications**](software-licensing-alerts-and-notifications.mdx) for details.

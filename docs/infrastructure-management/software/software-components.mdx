## Discover Software Components

When creating or editing a discovery job under **Discovery > Hypervisors / \*nix / Windows**, you will see the following autodiscovery form:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add discovery job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-discovery-job-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/add-discovery-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Scroll down to the **Software and Applications** section. By default, **Discover Software** is enabled to facilitate the autodiscovery of software on Windows and Linux machines in the defined CIDR blocks, hostnames, domain servers, or IP range(s).

<ThemedImage
  alt="The Discover Software option"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-and-applications-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-and-applications-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

All major Linux distributions are supported, and software registered across various package managers will be discovered.

### View Software Components

To view the full list of discovered software, navigate to **Resources > Software Components > All Software Components**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="All Software Components menu location"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-components-menu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-components-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
/>

As with other list views in Device42, you can sort the discovered software components using the column headers, the various **Advanced** filters on the right side of the page, the **search box** at the top of the page, or the bulk actions in the **Actions** dropdown.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Software component list page"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-component-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-component-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Click the software **Name** to view and edit an existing component.

## Manually Add a Software Component

Click **Add Software Component** to add a new component.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add new software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-component-add-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-component-add-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Enter the **Name**, **Software Type**, and **License Model**. You can also enter **Notes** and **Tags**. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page to save the component.

## Edit a Software Component

Click on the name of a software component and then select **Edit** to add additional details to its record. For example, you can specify a **License Model**, select a **Vendor**, add and define a **Category**, and add **Notes** and **Tags**.

Check the **Track Licensed Count by Keys** checkbox to base the software usage count on keys, rather than the total number of software component instances.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can also add **Software Component Aliases** and **Software License Keys**, view the actual instances of the discovered software under **Software In Use**, and add **Purchase/Support Info**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-2-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-2-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Change software component"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-3-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/change-component-3-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Bulk Actions

On the **All Software Components** list page, you can make bulk modifications to specific software components:

- Use the checkbox to the left of each instance to choose records from the list.
- Select an action from the **Actions** dropdown.
- In the dialog, confirm to execute the action.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Software component bulk actions"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-actions-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/software-license-management/software-actions-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '50%' }} 
/>

The available actions are:

- **Delete with Detailed Confirmation**
- **Fast Background Delete**
- **Export selected items**
- **Assign Software to Suite**
- **Refresh/update Software counts**
- **Refresh/update OS counts**
- **Mark selected Software as Managed**
- **Mark selected Software as Prohibited**
- **Mark selected Software as Ignored**
- **Mark selected Software as Unmanaged**

For example, you could select several software components and choose to:

- **Mark selected Software as Ignored** and Device42 would remove the components from the list and ignore them in future discoveries.
- **Mark selected Software as Prohibited** and Device42 would send alerts whenever prohibited software was found on a user's machine (if the alert was configured).
_ **Refresh/update Software counts** and the software counts (but not the autodiscovery job) would be run immediately.

:::note
The **Refresh/update Software counts** action is useful when you have changed the licensing or software count configuration and want to see the impact of the change immediately.
:::

### Assign Software to Suite

The **Assign Software to Suite** action is also useful, as it allows you to group selected software components into sets.

For example, if you wanted to group Adobe products, you would create a suite and then assign Adobe software components to it.

- To create the suite, you could either select an existing software component and define it as a suite or create a new software component using the **Add Software Component** button and call it something like "Adobe Software Suite".
- Then, you could select Adobe software components from the list, choose **Assign Software to Suite** from the **Actions** dropdown, and click the action to assign the selected software components to an Adobe suite.

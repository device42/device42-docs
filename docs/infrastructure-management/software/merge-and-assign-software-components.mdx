## Merge and Assign Software Components to a Suite

You can merge software components and assign them to a component suite as follows:

- Navigate to **Resources > Software Components > All Software Components** to view the **Software Components** list page.
- Select the components you want to merge, choose **Assign Software to Suite** from the **Actions** dropdown, and confirm to run the action.

      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-components/merge-assign-software-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-components/merge-assign-software-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- In the **Assign Software to Suite** dialog, click **Select Software Suite** and search for an existing software component to create the suite that the selected components will be assigned to, then click **Assign** to confirm.

    }}
  />

## View Assigned Components in a Suite

To view the software components in a suite, select the suite **Name** from the **Software Components** list page. The assigned software components are listed in the **Software Components in this Suite** box.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-components/software-components-in-suite-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/merge-assign-software-components//software-components-in-suite-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Merging Software Components with the Same Name

To merge software components with the same name into a suite, you must first merge them together, then merge them into a suite. A new component suite cannot have the same **name + vendor** combination as an existing software component; it must have a unique **name + vendor** combination.


For example, if you had:

1. A software component `ABC`, with the vendor `Cisco`.
2. A software component `ABC`, with the vendor `MS`.
3. A software component `ABC-Suite`, with the vendor `None`.

You could merge either `1.` **or** `2.` into `3.` without problem. However, if you tried to merge `1.` **and** `2.` into `3.`, you would receive a validation error prompting you to merge `1.` with `2.` before trying to merge them into `3.`.

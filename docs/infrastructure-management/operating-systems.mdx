Device42 tracks which devices are running which Operating Systems (OS). This module also ties into Software License Management so that you can see how many copies you are licensed for and how many you are actually using.

Navigate to **Resources > Operating Systems > All Operating Systems** to locate the Operating Systems list.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/operating-systems/operating-systems-enrichai-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

If the OS is standardized and enriched by the EnrichAI Cloud Service, an **AI icon** will be displayed to the right of its name.

The Operating Systems list page shows all of your operating systems and includes the **Total Count** of devices running the OS, the **Discovered Licensed Count**, and the number of OSs that are not licensed (named **Discovered Non-Licensed Count**). If you click on one of the listed operating systems, you will see details including which machines are running the OS.

## EnrichAI Operating System Fields

If the OS record has been enriched, key maintenance dates may be displayed in the **Enriched Data** section along with other OS details.

See the [Operating System Attributes](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.mdx#operating-system-attributes) and [Key Support Dates](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/index.mdx#key-support-dates) sections of the [EnrichAI Data](auto-discovery/enrichai-data/#operating-system-attributes) page for the list of fields that can be populated through EnrichAI.

Note that data will only be populated by EnrichAI if it's used by the OS vendor and if the data is available.

Operating System fields that contain data from EnrichAI cannot be edited or changed.

### Disable OS changes via API, Discovery, or EnrichAI

You can prevent non-manual changes being made to OS data. On the OS view, click the **Edit** button and turn on the **Don't change via API/Discovery/EnrichAI** option for device OSs.

## OS Update Logic for Devices

Each discovery job in Device42 assigns an accuracy score to the OS it detects. Device42 will only update a device's OS information for newly discovered OS on the same device if the accuracy score is equal to or greater than the prior OS accuracy score.

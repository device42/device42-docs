  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/dns-records/wpid576-Types_of_Records-light.png'),

A/AAAA, CNAME, MX and PTR records are supported and can be automatically populated using [DNS auto-discovery.](auto-discovery/setup-dns-autodiscovery.mdx)

A/AAAA records are automatically associated with existing IP addresses (or can be associated with new IP Addresses when they are created).

You can search for records or filter by domain to edit/view certain records.

The list view of MAC addresses shows the address, interface, VLAN, Device and Switch port connectivity. You can filter MACs by VLAN and/or switches. You can also search for full or partial MAC address from the search bar.

### Add/Edit Page

We are skipping the view page here, as it gives the same information as edit page. In add/edit page, you can pick/add VLANs, devices and switch ports. The history shows any changes made by Admin users.

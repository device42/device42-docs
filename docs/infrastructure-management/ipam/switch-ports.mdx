Switch ports can be autodiscovered using SNMP network discovery. 

You can bulk add switch ports via [switch templates](switch-templates.md), or use the [Device42 RESTful APIs](https://api.device42.com/#/IPAM) for an easy way to programmatically add or edit many switch ports at once.

### Ports List Page

Navigate to the Ports list page under **Resources > Ports** from the main menu. 

From the list page you can view and edit existing switch ports by clicking on any port ID. Add one or more new ports by clicking the **+ Add Port** button on the upper right:

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/ports-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can also access the Ports list page via the **Switch Ports** button on the device page related to that switch:

  }}
/>

### Switch Port Properties

Discovered ports use the **Is Default** property to indicate if a port is the primary interface or IP address.

![Default port property](/assets/images/switch-ports/default-port-property.png)

Switch ports include the following properties:

**Port:** Name of the switch port as found during autodiscovery, or user generated.  
**Name:** As found in autodiscovery or user generated.  
**Description:** As found in autodiscovery or user generated.  
**Type:** Add the type of port. Use the **+ button** to add a new type.  
**Network Device:** A device with network switch value as checked.  
**VLANs:** All the VLANs this port belongs to. 
**Module:** If this port is part of a module in a chassis-based switch, the module association can be made here.  
**Asset:** If the port is part of FEX or a similar asset connected to the switch, that association can be made here. You can either assign it to a module or asset.  
**Network Switch 2nd:** For stacked switches, this is the clustered switch. For paired switches, this is the second switch through which port can be managed.

Module, Asset and the Network switch 2nd association can be done efficiently using [switch templates](switch-templates.md).

**Up:** Whether the port is up or not.  
**Up admin:** Whether the port is administratively up or not. 
**Count:** Count in the number of ports. 
**Discovered type:** The port type as discovered during autodiscovery. This field is read-only. The discovered type value can be used to mark certain ports as uncounted, delete ports, or ignore certain port types in autodiscovery.  
**Remote Port:** If the port is connected to another switch port, you can make that association here. This can be autodiscovered as well.  
**Don't change via API:** If you override remote port connectivity manually, check this so autodiscovery or an API doesn't make this change automatically.  
**Tags:** A comma-separated list of tags you would like attributed to the switch port. 
**HW Address:** Any MAC addresses and devices connected to the switch port and the VLAN associated with the MAC address.

### Add a New Switch Port

Click the **+ Add Port** button on the upper right of the Ports list page and fill in the details of the port:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add new switch port"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-port-1-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-port-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Add more port details:

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-port-2-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-port-2-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Scroll down to add **Port Aliases**, **Parts**, and see **Custom Fields**:

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-port-3-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-port-3-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Switch Port Bulk Operations

Perform bulk operations by selecting ports from the table and choosing an action in the dropdown menu. Click the **icon hammer** to execute the action.

For example, you can filter ports by up/down status, network switch, or discovered type, and select the ports to be not be counted in the total:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Switch port action menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/port-action-menu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/port-action-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Switch Port Count

In the rack layout view, the hover-over popup shows the total "counted" ports and up ports for that switch.  

Also, from the switch port list page, you can filter by switch and up/down status to show the count of filtered ports.

### Switch Port Visualization

For physical switches, click **Impact Chart** to see all the ports with connectivity, including each MAC-to-device relationship. Virtual devices are shown as 2nd layer devices that are connected to its vHost, or with a '?' character if the vHost is unknown. 

<ThemedImage

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/impact-chart-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### How Do I Represent a Stacked Switch?

All switches, stacked or not, are represented according to their underlying hardware model. Stacked switches are represented by configuring their hardware model. To add an instance of a stacked switch, select the underlying hardware model that you created previously.

To add a new stacked switch, head to **DataCenter > Hardware Models** and click **+ Add a device Hardware Model**. Create a new device hardware model by supplying a **Name**, **Physical Subtype**, and other basic information, check the **Network Device** checkbox.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/impact-chart-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### How To Represent FEX Modules?

FEX modules can be added as an asset and then associated with the switch using asset device relations. This is easier to add using [switch templates](switch-templates.md).

To add a new asset, navigate to **Resources > All Assets** and click **+ Add Asset**. Name the asset and under **Type** select **Fabric Extender**.  

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add asset with Fabric Extender type"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-asset-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/switch-ports/add-asset-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Scroll down the Add Asset page, click **Add another Asset Device Relation**, and use the magnifying glass icon to associate the switch to the new asset.

IP Nat/Map functions are used for routing, such as routing external IPs to internal IPs or routing traffic within different network segments. You define IP Nat/Maps as they are not found during discovery.

- To create an IP Nat/Map, go to _Resources > IPs > IP NAT_ to display Nat/Map list page, and then click _Add IP Nat/Map_ at the top right.

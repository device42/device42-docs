### Cabling Overview

The Device42 cables module can track the origin, end connection(s), length, and path for each of your cables.

The origin and endpoint types can be patch panel ports, switch ports, devices, circuits, or other cables. A given cable endpoint can also be an origin for multiple other cables.

Find the Add Cable screen under **Hardware > Cables**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cables/201802add-cables-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Cables also have their own unique properties (see the Add Cable screen in the above image). In addition to length, connector type, and location, cables support [custom fields](../../administration/custom-key-value-pairs-explained.mdx).

### Drag-and-Drop Cabling From the Rack View

From the rack view, you can create, move, edit, and trace cables visually via the drag-and-drop functionality, in addition to the above method.

From the rack view (**Data Center > Racks > Your Rack > View Rack Layout**), you can also view or add a cable connection by clicking **Physical Connections** under **Rack Details** on the left and enabling Edit mode:

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cables/2018002-add_cable_visually-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### View Cables on Impact Charts

If your network device has cables connected to it (a load balancer, for example), you can view those connections in the device's impact chart. See the following image:

  }}

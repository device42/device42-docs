In this chapter, we will take a step by step approach to create patch panels from scratch to end result.

### The Goal

The example is simpler in nature, but this will cover the basics of how to add patch panel connections in Device42.

End goal is:

1. Patch Panel A is connected to Patch panel B : Panel A Panel B.
2. Patch panel A is patched to switch-01.
3. Patch panel B is patched to devices in the same rack as Panel B.

This will give us devices connectivity with switch ports.

### Creating Patch Panel Models

![](/assets/images/WEB-599_patch-panel-model-add.png)

Before we add the patch panel, we need to create the template. In this example, this is a singular patch panel with 48 RJ-45 ports. Steps taken:

- Go to _Resources > Assets > Patch Panel Models > Add Patch Panel Model_.
- Add a name, port type, the number of ports etc., for the model.
- _Save_ the patch panel model.

1. Go to _Resources > All Assets > Add Asset_.
2. Give the name Panel A, choose the _Type_ Patch Panel, and choose the model created above.
3. Click _Save_.

Repeat the same steps for Panel B, just change the name to Panel B in step 2.

You can also specify the building, storage room, add tags and images of the front and back.

### Adding the Back Connections or Termination

1. Go to _Tools > Templates & Bulk Operations > Panel Back Connectivity_.
2. From the drop-down, choose _Patch Panel_ A, then select the beginning _port # from:_ 1_;_ next, select _port # to:_ 48, then select _Patch Panel_ B, _port # from:_ 1, and optionally, the _Cable Type_.
3. Click _Continue_.

Now Panel A and Panel B are terminated to each other.

### Patching Switch Ports to Panel A

- Go to _Tools > Templates & Bulk Operations > Import/Export (xls)_.

- Scroll down to _Patch Panel Ports_.

In this example, ports from switch-01 are patched to Panel A. (You can create switch ports in bulk using switch templates as discussed under [Switch Templates](infrastructure-management/ipam/switch-templates.mdx)).

The tedious way to do this will be to add each switch port to each panel port. But we are not going to do that. The recommended way to do the same is to use the API Excel import option. Steps:

1. Download the sample excel file from _Create/update Patch Panel Ports_ in that page.
2. Our columns will look like this: **number    patch\_panel\_id    switch    switchport**
3. Add the rows for panel port number, panel ID (available from Asset list view/from APIs/or get using hover over in the status bar), switch name, and switch port name.
4. Import the XLS sheet.

Upon import, you can see the switch ports connections on Panel A.

### Patching Devices to Panel B

![wpid3704-patch_panel_device_excel.png](/assets/images/wpid3704-patch_panel_device_excel.png)

In this step, we will use the same sample excel sheet downloaded in step above.

Column layout will be a little different and will look like this: **number    patch\_panel\_id    device    obj\_label1**

Once we add the values to Excel and import it, the panel B will show following.

### Patch Panel Layout

![wpid3709-patch_panel_visual_layout.png](/assets/images/wpid3709-patch_panel_visual_layout.png)

Now if you go to Patch panel layout for Panel B and hover over any port or device, you will see the full visual path for that port.

### Switch Port Level Connectivity

![wpid3710-switch_port_view.png](/assets/images/wpid3710-switch_port_view.png)

You will see the patch panel connectivity from each switch port view as well.

### Device Level Connectivity

![wpid3700-device_connectivity_patch_panel.png](/assets/images/wpid3700-device_connectivity_patch_panel.png)

Similarly, in the Device view/edit page, you will see the patch panel connection under the tab "other".

This concludes our chapter on how to create a patch panel layout in Device42.

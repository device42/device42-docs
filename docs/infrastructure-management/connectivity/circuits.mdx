The Circuits module tracks both origin and end connections. The origin and end point types can be a patch panel port, switch port, a device, or another circuit.

The module also tracks order date, provision date, turn on date and contract start/end dates.

File attachments, custom fields and purchase/support info are also available on this screen.

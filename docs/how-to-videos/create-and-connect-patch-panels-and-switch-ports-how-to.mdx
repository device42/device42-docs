title: "Create and Connect Patch Panels and Switch Ports How to"

This is a simple demonstration that involves creating and adding two patch panels to a Rack in Device42, and connecting them both together and to a switch in three different ways! The demonstration assumes you have at least one Building, Room, and Rack with a switch created in Device42, but you can still follow along if you don’t, creating them on the fly.

The first panel, “Panel A”, will be a 48-port model, mounted facing forward and connected the all 48 ports of the switch. The second panel, “Panel B”, is a 24-port model, mounted on the top of the rack facing rearward, for server connectivity. Panel A is patched to Panel B, providing servers in the rack connectivity to switch ports.

Device42's Generic import tool helps you import your Excel or CSV lists of Inventories, Servers, or Other Devices and any other related data you may have stored about them.

IP's, Server names, Notes -- Anything you recorded about a given asset/server/subject can be stored in Device42 by mapping the Columns to fields in Device42. And, if Device42 doesn't have an appropriate matching field, a custom field can be easily created right from within the tool.

Please leave any questions, comments, or requests for more how-to's as comments on the video, or e-mail support@device42.com and say you saw it on our docs site!

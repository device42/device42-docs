Why am I not discovering a device? Maybe you have 10 servers, and only 8 were successfully discovered ... How can you troubleshoot it? In this video, we'll do a couple sample discovery scenarios \[both Linux & Windows\], and show how to use diagnostic features in Device42 to uncover where the failure occurred, and then utilize the Device42 credentials tool to further troubleshoot credentials against a Windows server that is up, but failed a previous discovery run.

Please leave any questions, comments about the video, or requests for new How To's below!

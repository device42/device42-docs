With Device42 Packet Capture you can discover service communications happening in real-time for any service listeners known to Device42. By listening directly to all network communications, you'll easily discover communications that happen infrequently.

## Packet Capture Prerequisites

- A functioning Device42 MA (destination for captured data).
- Network communication allowed from the machine you’ll be capturing packets on to your Device42 MA.
- An active network adapter connected to the target traffic capture network.
- If using Windows, a WinPcap-compatible library (like npcap) must be installed – Be sure to select the option “install in API-Compatible mode”during setup!
- If using Linux, libpcap must be installed to support packet capture.
- OPTIONAL: Promiscuous mode \[aka ‘monitor’ mode\] enabled for the network and/or the interface of interest.

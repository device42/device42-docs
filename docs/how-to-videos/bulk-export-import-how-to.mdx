The Device42 Bulk Import \[export/import\] tool is really handy for quickly making changes to a large amount of CI's at once. With bulk export, you can easily export either ALL of your Device42 data, or any chosen subset of CI's. You can add data (e.g. add 100 rows), sort & update data, add a column (as long as the API supports it), and quickly re-import the changes.

Please leave any questions about the tool, comments, or requests for new How To's as comments on the video, or e-mail support@device42.com!

A new video is in the works! Please see the [Advanced Routing page](administration/advanced-routing.mdx).
:::

NOTE: This demo assumes you have already added a NIC that can connect to your new network. To Add supplemental interfaces (NO GATEWAY IP or DNS for secondary NICs!!!) for connectivity to the appropriate network segments, see our [How-To add a NIC to Device42 walkthrough](/administration/appliance-manager/adding-multiple-network-interface-cardsnic-to-device42-vm/) on this docs site.

Also note this particular How-To is only a demo of the process, so your screen output will be slightly different as the Lab Machine doesn’t have a secondary NIC or network to connect to.

Leave a comment or email Device42 Support and let us know if you’d like a video of that process as well!

Please leave any questions, comments, or requests for more how-to's as comments on the video, or email support@device42.com and say you saw it on our docs site!

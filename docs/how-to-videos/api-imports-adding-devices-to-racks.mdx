**Transcript**  
_Hi, this is Marc from Device42. Let's talk about how-to add devices to racks using API Imports. In Device42 you can add and/or update almost any data using the REST API. This same functionality has been extended to enable the import of almost any data using a simple Excel spreadsheet._

_Here you see the API Import page, let's download a sample file. Let's take a look at the documentation for this import. Here we see the documentation for the add/update a device in a rack API call. I have entered my device data into the sample sheet - devices can be existing or new. Hardware model is optional. If the rack name is unique, building, room, and row are optional. The starting U location in required, use "auto" to assign the next available slot. After the import, we will rearrange the devices in rack layout view using drag and drop._

_Let's go ahead and import the data...choose the file, click import, the results are displayed upon completion._

_Let's take a look at the devices that were added to Rack 4. In rack layout view, devices can be rearranged using drag and drop...devices can be moved within a rack, and between racks._

_This concludes our video, thanks for watching!_

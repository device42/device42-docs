**Transcript**  
_Hi, this is Raj. Let's talk about hidden menus. Head over to any object where a field you want to edit is referenced. Click on the field, and using breadcrumbs you can get to the list page where you can edit or delete just like any other object in Device42. You cannot edit or delete system defined objects. But others are editable as shown. You can get to any referenced object and make changes to suit your needs._

_This concludes this video, thanks for watching!_

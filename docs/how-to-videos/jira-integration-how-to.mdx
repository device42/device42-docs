Some configuration was done beforehand to keep the video as direct as possible so as not bore those of you who create JIRA workflows regularly.

That said, a few screens may move a little quick if you are new to Jira workflows, so please don't hesitate to leave any questions or comments below and we'll be glad to follow up if pausing doesn't cut it or anything needs clarification!

In our latest 3.0.0 release, you can create Custom Jira Workflows with Device42 Custom Fields. Leverage Device42’s Conditional Functions, Validator Functions, and POST functions for powerful automated workflows!

Validate against Device42 Custom Fields and/or trigger conditions based upon data entered into them. You can also combine Conditions and Validators as you see fit, while also filtering both the data your Custom Field(s) make available to the user, as well as what _can be entered_ into the fields … and that’s not all … workflow transitions can be configured to send a POST to Device42, currently able to request the next available IP in a specified subnet.

Please leave any questions, comments, or requests for more how-to's as comments on the video, or e-mail support@device42.com and say you saw it on our docs site!

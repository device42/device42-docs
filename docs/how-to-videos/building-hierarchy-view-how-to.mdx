**_NOTE_** This feature is no longer called "Tree View". It can now be found (as seen pictured in this video) under the "DATACENTER" menu, entitled "Building Hierarchy".

Please leave any questions about the tool, comments about the video, or requests for new How To's in the comments on the YouTube Video, or of course feel free to drop and email to support \{at} device42 \[dot\] .com!

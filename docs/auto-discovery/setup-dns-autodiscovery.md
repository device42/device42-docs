The following sections explain how to prepare your Microsoft DNS server for DNS autodiscovery and how to create and run a Device42 DNS Zone autodiscovery job.

## Microsoft Setup

### Allow Zone Transfers

First, **Allow zone transfers** from your DNS server to your Device42 virtual appliance IP address.

Right-click on the zone name, go to **Properties**, and go to the **Zone Transfers** tab.

### Allow the Device42 IP

Next, allow your Device42 virtual appliance's IP address.

You can enable zone transfers to your Device42 appliance's IP at your discretion.

## Set Up a DNS Zone Autodiscovery Job

Next, go back to your Device42 web console and navigate to the DNS Zones for Autodiscovery list page under **Discovery > DNS Zone Sync (One way)**. 

Click **+Add DNS Zone for Autodiscovery** to create a new autodiscovery job and fill out the following: 
- **Name:** Enter the name of the zone to be transferred - this will likely be the zone you just enabled.
- **Nameserver:** Enter the FQDN or IP address for the DNS server. The FQDN will work only if the DNS is configured correctly from the console. 
- **Auto Delete Enabled:** Check this box to delete records in Device42 that were not found in new transfers of the zone but were found in older transfers. Selecting this option also deletes any entries manually added in Device42 that have not yet been added to your DNS server.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/setup-dns-autodiscovery/add-new-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Save the autodiscovery job and click **Run Now** to test it. If you see "Success!" in the **Last Status** box, then the new zone, IPs, and related details will be available in Device42.

### Run Now or Schedule Discovery

Select **Run Now** from the autodiscovery list page to run the job immediately.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/setup-dns-autodiscovery/run-now-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

When creating or editing the job, select **Add another Auto Discovery Schedule** to schedule the job.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/setup-dns-autodiscovery/add-new-job-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/setup-dns-autodiscovery/add-new-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

:::note
Newly created jobs will not run on the first day they are created to prevent an unintentionally large number of jobs from running initially. If you would like to run a job after its initial creation, click the **Run Now** button.

To install the signed Mac Agent, do the following:

1. Download the **Signed Mac Agent for Discovery** from [https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/) for Intel or Apple Silicon macOS machines. 

2. Download the **Encrypted config file for Agent** from the agent screen on the Device42 Main Appliance, under **Discovery > Agent Based Scans**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/mac-agent/mac-agent-19.06-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

This will be an encrypted URL and a public key with some other data needed for discovery. It uses AES-256-bit encryption.

Run the agent as:
```
(sudo) <executable name> --config-file=<path>/d42_agent_config
```

To run the above:

- Unzip the notarized binary file.
- Store the config file somewhere on the file system.
- Run the binary calling the config file.

Enterprise customers should be able to do this via JAMF or other MDM solutions.

## Notes

- The `-config-file` switch only works for this executable, and won’t work for any agent executable downloaded from the Main Appliance.
- All other switches, like for overriding the host, will work for this executable and any agent downloaded from the Main Appliance.
- It won't auto-update (as that would break the signing) and needs to be manually updated or updated via MDM solutions.

## Troubleshooting

If the file doesn’t run, clear the quarantine attribute by running:

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine  <executable name> 
```

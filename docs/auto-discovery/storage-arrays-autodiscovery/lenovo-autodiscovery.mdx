## Autodiscovery of Lenovo ThinkSystem Arrays

Device42 supports the discovery of Lenovo ThinkSystem Storage Arrays via ThinkSystem SAN Manager. Once you've set up SAN Manager, Device42 will use its REST APIs to pull all the relevant information from your compatible ThinkSystem DE arrays, including DE2000, DE4000, and DE6000.

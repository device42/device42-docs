Device42 supports SSH-based Linux and UNIX discovery from the Main Appliance. For a full list of supported Linux and UNIX operating systems, please visit [Device42 Supported Operating Systems](operating-systems-supported-in-auto-discovery.mdx).

## Information Discovered

Provided you have successfully configured the discovery account and the data is available, Device42 will gather the following information:

- Device host information
- Parts
- Operating System
- Service processes
- Software installed
- Installed common applications and configuration files

Within the **Parts** section of device details, the CPU, RAM, and storage entries for the device will be displayed. You may also see additional information such as model number, slot, and location.

## Set Up Linux/Unix Autodiscovery

Before configuring an SSH-based discovery job, please be sure the SSH port (standard TCP port 22 or a custom port) is open between the Device42 Main Appliance or Remote Collector and the targeted Unix or Linux servers. 

Select **Discovery > Hypervisors / \*nix / Windows** from the main menu and click the **Create** button to add a discovery job to connect and gather host and VM details.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/nix-autodiscovery-page-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Choose **\*nix** as the platform, and enter your discovery target (hostnames, IPs or IP range, or CIDR), credentials, and job options.

### Discovery Job Option Definitions

- **Job Name:** User-defined name for the job.  
- **Remote Collector:** Select the remote collector to run the discovery job from (_optional_).  
- **Job Debug Level:** Select _Debug On_ for extra debug info, useful for a support ticket.  
- **Discovery Target(s):** Specify FQDN or IP of discovery target(s). If using FQDN, Device42 must be configured to resolve the DNS.  
- **Port:** This is 22 by default. Only change this if you have a different SSH port configured.  
- **Use telnet if SSH port is closed:** Fall back to telnet (port 23) if the SSH port is found to be closed.  
- **Collect database server information:** Select this option to discover Oracle database servers.  
- **Database Username/Password(s):** Username and password with database server permissions.  
- **ADM Sampling Interval:** Is _Off_ by default. Enter a sampling interval in minutes or hours.  
- **Enable Resource Utilization Tracking for Device(s):** Optionally enable the collection of resource utilization metrics from discovered devices.  
- **Resource Utilization Sampling Interval:** Set the interval for RU data collection (only in effect if RU Tracking is enabled).  
- **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s):** Use username with permission to connect to the Linux and Unix targets.  
- **Schedule for autodiscovery:** You can schedule the discovery to run at certain times.

:::caution
Please don't set up an autodiscovery scan using critical production account credentials.

Account lock-out could result in an otherwise completely avoidable outage depending on the permissions granted and your configured password policies. You are responsible for any such behavior that might result if you choose to ignore this requirement.
:::

### Option To Ignore IPs and MAC Addresses

You can prevent IP and MAC addresses from being included in our database during autodiscovery. Devices with these addresses will still be discovered but the detailed information that would typically be collected and stored is ignored.

Configure rules to ignore IP and MAC addresses for a specific job when creating or editing the job. 

- **Exclude Server(s):** List the server IPs to exclude from discovery. This is useful for ignoring individual IPs when the discovery target is specified as a range or CIDR block. 
- **Service Port Client IPs**: Do not discover client connections on specified listening ports.  

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Linux Unix job exclusions"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/exclude-server-port-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/exclude-server-port-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

- **Remote IP Exclusion**: Do not discover connections to or from any of these remote IPs.
- **Ignore Interfaces:** List the network interfaces to ignore during discovery.

            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/exclude-remote-ips-interfaces-dark.png'),
        }}
    />

- **Ignore IP(s):** Do not discover connections to or from any of these remote IPs.
- **Ignore MAC(s):** Do not discover connections to or from any of these remote MAC addresses.

        }}
    />

### Global Exclusions

Globally, you can add an **Exclusion** to ignore IP and MAC addresses for all jobs by navigating to **Tools > Settings > Global Settings** on the Main Appliance. 

<ThemedImage
    alt="Global Ignore options"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/global-ignore-light.png'),

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/nix-naming-options-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

- **Strip domain suffix:** Check this option to strip the domain suffix from discovered servers.
- **Domains to strip:** Enter an ordered list of domains to strip from hostname, listing one per line. If left blank, the full domain is stripped; if specified, the first match is stripped.  
- **Prioritize DNS domain name:** When checked, discovered devices will be named using the host name plus FQDN. If unchecked (default), discovered devices will use the host name plus the YP/NIS domain name. 
  :::note
  After upgrading to v19.06, existing jobs will have the **Prioritize DNS domain name** option disabled by default (devices will be named using the host name plus the YP/NIS domain name).
  :::
- **Set the device name as the name given in the server field of the autodiscovery job:** If checked and discovering via hostname or FQDN, the device will be named using the discovery target name provided.  
- **Overwrite existing device hostname with discovered hostname:** Check this option to give precedence to the discovered hostname.  
- **Device Name Format:** Select the desired device naming format.

    <ThemedImage
        alt="Device Name Format options"
        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/device-name-format-options-light.png'),
            dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/device-name-format-options-dark.png'),
        }}
        style={{ width: '45%' }} 
    />

    - **Hostname as Discovered:** If the domain is present and the domain is not in the name, it is set to `name`.
    - **Hostname plus Domain Name:** The device name becomes `name.domain`.
    - **Hostname and add Hostname plus Domain Name as Alias:** Names stay the same, and an alias is set as `name.domain`.
    - **Hostname Plus Domain Name and Add Host name as Alias:** The alias is set to `name` and the device name becomes `name.domain`.
  
### Host Discovery

Enabling the **Discover ProviderID/CloudID** option reveals the **Provider Token** option, which might be needed for authentication with the cloud service provider.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/nix-host-discovery-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

### Miscellaneous Options

The lower portion of the discovery job page includes a **Miscellaneous** tab that contains additional options for *nix discovery jobs. 

Specify the timeout range between 10 to 600 seconds in the **Timeout** field to set the maximum wait time for a server response.

## Configure SSH Key Auth for Discovery

SSH keys can be used for Linux discovery instead of a password. Setting up discovery to use an SSH key is a simple two-step process, and even easier if your servers are already configured for SSH key access. 

If you can already use an SSH key to log on to your servers with the desired discovery user account, get your SSH private key and proceed with Step 2.

1. Ensure your Linux target servers are configured for SSH public key auth, and if not, configure them.
    
2. Add your SSH RSA (or DSA) Private key to a credential in Device42, and use that credential to configure your discovery job otherwise, as you always have.
    
### Supported SSH Key Ciphers

Device42 supports the following ciphers for SSH-key-based discovery authentication:

- aes128-ctr
- aes192-ctr
- aes256-ctr
- aes128-gcm@openssh.com
- chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
- arcfour256
- arcfour128
- arcfour
- aes128-cbc
- 3des-cbc

### **Step 1**: Configure Discovery Target Servers for SSH Public Key Authentication

Configure Linux target servers for SSH public key authentication. You can create a new key pair or use an existing SSH key pair. To create a new key, generate an RSA key pair, use `ssh-keygen`, and run:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Running `ssh-keygen` will ask you to set the file location of the key pair. You can use the default location - typically `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`. Note that if a key already exists at this location, it will be overwritten unless you choose a different file location.

You will also be prompted to supply a passphrase (password) for your new private key. This is optional and you can leave it blank if you choose. 

For example:

```
Generating public/private RSA key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/vivek/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/vivek/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/vivek/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
80:5f:25:7c:f4:90:aa:e1:f4:a0:01:43:4e:e8:bc:f5 vivek@desktop01
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
| oo    ...+.     |
|.oo  .  .ooo     |
|o .o. . .o  .    |
| o ...+o.        |
|  o .=.=S        |
| .  .Eo .        |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+
```

The following two files will be created by the command you just ran:

- **`$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`:** Contains your private key.
- **`$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`:** Contains your public key.

Save a copy of the **id_rsa** file (this is your private key) somewhere on your local machine so you can browse to it and upload it to Device42.

Use `$ssh-copy-id` to copy the newly generated certificate to your target host(s): 

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub discovery_user@discoverytarget.device42.com
```
This sets up your target hosts for remote SSH-key-based authentication using the same user account you used to run the command. Verify that your SSH key-based login works from a remote terminal and proceed to [Step 2](#step-2-create-a-discovery-job-that-uses-ssh-key-auth) to set up your Linux discovery job.   

**Manual Set Up Option**

Instead of using `ssh-copy-id`, you can log in to the target servers and manually set up the authentication: 
- Create the `.ssh` directory in the home directory you'll be using for discovery and create an **authorized_keys** file in it. 
- Substitute `$HOME` with your discovery user's username and set the permissions by running: 
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh 
chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh
```
- Create the `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` file if it doesn't already exist. 
- Copy the newly generated public key (copy the entire file) and paste it on a new line in the `authorized_keys` file. It will look something like this: 
![authorized_key file with public key contents ](/assets/images/authorized_key-contents.png)

### **Step 2:** Create a Discovery Job With SSH Key Auth

Add your private SSH RSA or DSA Private key created in [Step 1](#step-1-configure-discovery-target-servers-for-ssh-public-key-authentication) to your Device42 instance's discovery job. 

- Set up a new discovery job. Go to **Discovery > HyperVisors / \*nix / Windows** and click **+ Add Hypervisors/\*nix/win for Autodiscovery**.
- Select a credential for the **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s)** field that includes the SSH key file instead of a password. 
- You can also add the file via the discovery job page, or by going to **Resources > All Secrets** and clicking **Create**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Add Secret"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/add-secret-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/add-secret-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

If you set a passphrase for your SSH key, check the **Use Password** box and supply the SSH key file's password and SSH key. Note that you can do this later by editing your created credential (called a Secret). 

You're all set to run Linux discovery using an SSH key! Save and run your discovery job. 

### Download the Key File

You can download the key file when needed. Navigate to **Resources > All Secrets** and select the Secret with the SSH key file.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Download key file from Secret"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/download-key-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/download-key-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

## Configure Linux Hostname Discovery Details

When discovering a device name, the first command to check is `hostname` to derive the short name of the host. After running the hostname, run the following commands to obtain the domain name. They're ordered by which command's results we give the most weight to:

```
domainname
```
```
dnsdomainname
```
```
ypdomainname
```
```
nisdomainname
```

If you don't get a domain name with any of those commands, try running `cat /etc/resolv.conf`. In this case, split the text on the white space in the file and look for a `domain` token. When you see one, assign the domain as the second token after `domain`.

## Run *nix SSH Discovery Job

After saving a discovery job, you can run it immediately using the **Run Now** button on the view and edit pages of the specific job, or you can run it from the list page grid under **Discovery > HyperVisors / \*nix / Windows**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Run job from the list page"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/run-now-button-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/run-now-button-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Select **Add another Autodiscovery Schedule** when editing a job to create a run schedule for the job.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Schedule the discovery job"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/autodiscovery-schedule-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery/autodiscovery-schedule-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

:::note
Newly created jobs will not run on the day they are created to prevent an excessive number of jobs running simultaneously. To run a job after creating it, select the **Run Now** button next to the job.

## Linux Considerations

Linux autodiscovery has been tested against Redhat, Debian, CentOS, Ubuntu, and Oracle distributions and should work fine against just about all similar Linux distributions.

Confirm compatibility by checking to see if your platform supports the following commands:

- **Hostname:**
    ```
    /bin/hostname
    ```

- **Manufacturer, Hardware, and Serial #:**
    ```
    sudo /usr/sbin/dmidecode -s system-manufacturer 
    ```
    ```
    sudo /usr/sbin/dmidecode -s system-product-name 
    ```
    ```
    sudo /usr/sbin/dmidecode -s system-serial-number
    ```

- **IP Info:** 
    ```
    /sbin/ifconfig -a
    ```

- **Memory:** 
    ```
    cat /proc/meminfo
    ```

- **CPU Info:**
    ```
    sudo /usr/sbin/dmidecode
    ```

## Linux Permissions

Several commands are run as part of the Linux autodiscovery process that, by default, typically require root privileges. We do extensive testing to see which commands we can run without `sudo` while still obtaining all available information. 

The following is a table of commands we sometimes or always run as `sudo`. For the "Sometimes" commands, we'll try to run the command first without `sudo`, and if we receive a "permission denied" command rather than an "invalid command", "command not found", or similar, we'll attempt to run it as `sudo`. This list also specifies whether the command is run on every Linux or UNIX flavor, or only certain platforms:

| Command             | Run with sudo? | OS flavor                                                 |

Below you can see an example of how to allow a particular user or group to run a specific sudo command without being prompted for a password:

```
**%your-group-here ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/dmidecode, /sbin/hdparm, /sbin/fdisk**
```

Adjust the above paths as needed to match the location of each program. If these permissions are missing, the autodiscovery client will not be able to discover hardware, manufacturer, serial number, and so on, as well as service dependencies and valuable application configuration information. You might also have to comment out `Default Require tty` in the `/etc/sudoers` file.

## SUDO PATH in Non-Interactive Shells

If you have a Linux discovery where Device42 uses a non-interactive shell, Device42 may try the commands multiple times because the `PATH` is not set in non-interactive shells.

You can set that information in the `sudoers` file for the service account to prevent these commands from being executed multiple times. It should be there by default, but sometimes it's commented out or removed for security hardening.

It's not a bug, but some deployments may see security alerts for invalid commands being executed because of this.

In sudoers, there should be a line as follows:
```
Defaults secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
```

You could alternatively make the defaults particular to just the discovery account like so:
```
Defaults:DISCOVERY_ACCOUNT

secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
```

title: "Vendors Supported in SNMP Autodiscovery"

Device42 aims to support as many vendors as possible for SNMP-based discovery. Here's a list of vendors that we have verified support for.

Note that this list is not all-inclusive; it's intended to give a sense of the vendors that we support. 

Even if the vendor is not listed, discovery will generally still bring in some information even if your specific hardware has not yet been added. 

## Vendors that we've verified support for include:

## Adding support for non-verified vendors

If you come across a device that isn't fully discovered or if you have hardware that you want to see supported, you can [generate an SNMP walk of the device](administration/appliance-manager/collecting-snmpwalk-output-for-troubleshooting.md) by navigating to **Application > Generate SNMP Template** in your Appliance Manager.

Fill out the form, attach your MIB files, and select the standard data you want added. Once you've completed this form, it will be routed to our engineers for inclusion!

Device42 supports the autodiscovery of SSL certificates for easy tracking in Device42.

:::info
This page is about creating a certificate discovery job. See [Certificates](/infrastructure-management/certificate-management.mdx) for information about managing discovered certificates.

## Add SSL Certificate Discovery Job

Create a new certificate autodiscovery job by navigating to **Discovery > Certificates** and clicking the **+ Add Certificate autodiscovery spec** button.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Certificate autodiscovery specs"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/certificate-discovery-list-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/certificate-discovery-list-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

When creating a certificate autodiscovery job, enter an IP address or range of IP addresses and the ports to scan. Device42 will import discovered certificates. A certificate discovered on an IP address already associated with a device in Device42 will automatically be associated with that device.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add new certificate autodiscovery job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/add-discovery-job-top-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/add-discovery-job-top-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

Schedule the certificate autodiscovery job to run at a specific time on selected days by clicking on the **+ Add another Autodiscovery Schedule** button.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add new certificate autodiscovery job schedule"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/add-discovery-job-bottom-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/add-discovery-job-bottom-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Newly created jobs will not run on the day they are created to prevent the unintended running of many jobs simultaneously. To run a job after its initial creation, click **Run Now** next to the job.

### SSL Certificate Cipher Suite Discovery

Device42 can discover SSL cipher suites as part of certificate autodiscovery. If you'd like to discover cipher suites, check the **Find cipher suites supported by the server** checkbox.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Cipher suites option"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/cipher-suites-option-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/certificate-management/cipher-suites-option-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
/>

Choosing to discover cipher suites can significantly slow down SSL certificate discovery. To resolve any issues caused by a slow discovery job or speed up your regular scheduled SSL certificate discovery job, uncheck **Find cipher suites supported by server**.

Navigate to the certificates list pages under **Applications > Certificates** to inspect the discovered certificates. 

### Multitenancy Warning

Certificate discovery can fail if [multitenancy](/administration/role-based-access-control/role-based-permissions-and-access.mdx) is enabled and the discovery job targets a VRF group whose subnet doesn't exist in Device42.

If you encounter this behavior, create the target subnet in Device42 or run a network discovery first, as recommended in [autodiscovery best practices](autodisc-best-practices.md).

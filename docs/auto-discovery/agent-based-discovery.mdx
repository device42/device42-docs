# Device42 Discovery Agent

:::tip
To learn about using the agent for **offline** discovery, see [Agent-Based Offline Discovery](agent-based-offline-discovery.mdx).
:::

There are special situations where using an agent for discovery makes more sense. The IT environment may be unreachable from the network or security-hardened rules may be in place that limit traffic flow. Device42 offers many optional auto-discovery agents across several [supported platforms](#supported-platforms).

As a best practice, we recommend using agentless discovery over agent based discovery when possible. The information gathered is the same, but the agent does not support Resource utilization. 

:::warning
**Discovery Account warning: Please do _not_ set up an autodiscovery scan using critical or production account credentials! Please create a separate, dedicated account to use _only_ for discovery**

Doing so, depending on permissions granted and configured password policies could result in account lock-out, therefore causing an otherwise completely avoidable outage.
:::

:::info
See **[Windows Discovery Agent Service Wrapper](getstarted/installation/windows-service-installation.mdx)** and **[Mac Agent Service Launcher](mac-agent-service-launcher.mdx)** for information on installing versions of the Windows and Mac discovery agent as a service.

## Proxy Environment Variables

Proxy settings are not required, but if you need the agents to access your network via a proxy, you can set the following environment variables, which the agents will respect:

- **HTTP_PROXY:** Define the HTTP proxy server.
- **HTTPS_PROXY:** Define the HTTPS proxy server.
- **NO_PROXY:** A comma-separated list of IP addresses that should not go through the proxy.

On Windows, click the **Environmental Variables** button in the System Properties window to set environment variables.

## Installation

Download the client from **Discovery > Agent Based Scans**. Enter the URL as it will be accessed by the agent from the remote machine, and choose your **Platform** from the dropdown: Windows, Mac, Linux, FreeBSD, and so on.

## Scheduling With Crontab in Linux

For best results, we recommend running the command with `sudo`. Make sure that `/home/system\_dev42/bin/d42agent` is owned by `root` with `\-rwx—— (0700)` permissions. This prevents the non-root user `system\_dev42` from overwriting the agent or adding it to `root`’s _crontab_ (or `cron.daily/hourly`) while allowing root to execute it.

### Using a Limited Account

The Linux agent runs as `root` by default. However, it is possible to configure the agent to run with a limited, non-root account. Here's how you can create one:

1. **Create a limited account**:
   - Create a new Linux account (for example, `d42_limited`) without root access.
   - Disable login access to ensure the account cannot be used for remote shell access. Use the following command:

     ```bash
     sudo useradd -r -s /usr/sbin/nologin d42_limited
     ```

2. **Grant sudo permissions for required commands**:
   - Assign the account permission to run the commands required by the discovery agent. Edit the `/etc/sudoers` file using `visudo`:

     ```bash
     sudo visudo
     ```

   - Add the following entry to grant `d42_limited` access to specific commands:

     ```
     d42_limited ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/arp, /bin/cat, /sbin/ifconfig, /usr/bin/curl, /usr/bin/wget, /bin/ls, /usr/sbin/dmidecode, /usr/bin/lsof, /usr/bin/ps, /usr/bin/python3, /bin/uname, /usr/bin/systemctl, /sbin/ip, /usr/bin/df, /usr/bin/free, /usr/bin/mount, /usr/sbin/iptables
     ```

     Read the [Commands Required by the Discovery Agent](#commands-required-by-the-discovery-agent) section to see the full list of commands required by the agent.

3. **Configure the file ownership and permissions**:
   - Make sure that the `d42agent` binary is still owned by `root` and has restricted permissions:

     ```bash
     sudo chown root:root /home/system_dev42/bin/d42agent
     sudo chmod 0700 /home/system_dev42/bin/d42agent
     ```

4. **Run the agent with the limited account**:
   - Use `sudo` to execute the agent with the limited account:
   
     ```bash
     sudo -u d42_limited /home/system_dev42/bin/d42agent
     ```

### Commands Required by the Discovery Agent

The limited account must have access to the following commands to ensure proper functionality:

```bash
arp
cat
chkconfig
crontab
curl
df
dmesg
dmidecode
docker
dpkg
fdisk
find
format
getconf
grep
hdparm
hostname
ifconfig
ip
iptables
lsof
lsblk
lspci
mount
netstat
ps
python3
rpm
service
systemctl
uname
wget
```

We need to ensure the limited account can execute all these commands through `sudo` without requiring a password.

Here's a shell script that can be used to check whether the limited account has access to the commands:

```bash 
#!/bin/bash

# List of commands required by the discovery agent
commands=(
    arp
    cat
    chkconfig
    ...
    # Add the rest of the commands from the list above
)

# Check if the limited account has access to all the required commands
for command in "${commands[@]}"; do
    sudo -u d42_limited command -v $command > /dev/null 2>&1
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Command $command not found or not executable by d42_limited"
    fi
done
```

You can run this script to verify that the limited account has access to all the required commands.

## Linux and Mac Note

After downloading the agent, make it executable by running the command `chmod +x <agentname>` and use `sudo` for best results. Use the command `--sudo-password="password"` to pass in the password.

:::note
You may experience an issue with opening the application on your Mac. If so, please use the following Apple support link to [open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
:::

## Windows Note

After downloading the agent, use the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule the executable file (\*.exe) to run at the intervals you define.

## View Agent Version and Agent Last Check-in Date

The Devices list page now includes two columns that display the **Agent Version** and the **Agent Last Check-in Date** for devices discovered by the agent.

- On the Devices list page under **Resources > All Devices**, click the **gear icon** below the Advanced button to display the column list.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Gear icon on Devices list page"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/devices-gear-icon-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/devices-gear-icon-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '90%' }} 
    />
 
- Select **Agent Version** and **Agent Last Check-in Date** from the **Table Columns** dropdown.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Table column selection"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/table-columns-light-3.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/table-columns-dark-3.png'),
    }}
    />

- If you want to define a new column view, type a name for the view in the field to the right of the **Table Columns** dropdown and **Save** the view. Device42 displays the agent information for devices discovered by the agent.

### Filtering with Agent Columns

You can use Agent Version and Agent Last Check-in Date to filter the devices list to look for devices found by specific agents or during certain periods.

- Click **+More** to add the columns as search criteria.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Display more columns"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/more-button-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/more-button-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- You can then click on the column name to use the column as a filter. For example, you can use **Agent Last Check-in Date** to search for devices discovered by an agent during a certain calendar period.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Filter by Agent date"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/check-in-date-light-3.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/check-in-date-dark-3.png'),
    }}
    />

- You can also use the agent columns in **Advanced search**. For example, the query below searches for devices discovered with a **Agent Last Check-in Date** less than 365 days ago.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Advanced search"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/advanced-search-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/agent-based-discovery/advanced-search-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

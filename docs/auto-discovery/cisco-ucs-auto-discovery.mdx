:::info
Load balancers share the discovery job page of the Main Appliance. See the [F5/Load balancer discovery](load-balancer-f5-autodiscovery.mdx) page if you are looking for load balancer discovery information.
:::

Device42 will poll your Cisco UCS (Unified Computing System) Manager to discover cluster device information or ACI (Application Centric Infrastructure) Fabric to discover your SDN (software-defined networks).

From version 18.12, UCS discovery jobs have been expanded to include network connectivity information beyond the original Chassis and Blade relationship data for UCS clusters. You'll now have a comprehensive overview of your entire cluster's connectivity, complete with port-channel aggregation information.

## Setting up a Cisco UCS Cluster or ACI Fabric Discovery

Create a job by navigating to **Discovery > Autodiscovery > UCS/ACI/Load Balancers** to add and edit Cisco UCS manager information.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/UCS-ACI-Load-Balancers-menu-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/UCS-ACI-Load-Balancers-menu-19.06-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

Add your Cisco UCS Manager or ACI Fabric discovery job by entering one or more IPs or FQDNs, and scroll down to enter your username and password (with permissions) on the device.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/ucs-select-platform-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/ucs-select-platform-19.06-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

### **Scheduling UCS Cluster or ACI Fabric Discovery Jobs**

Schedule your autodiscovery job to run regularly on certain days and at specific times.

<ThemedImage

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/autodiscovery-schedule-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/autodiscovery-schedule-dark.png'),
  }}

## UCS Cluster / ACI Fabric Discovery Option Definitions

:::note
The following options only exist for UCS and ACI devices.
:::

- **Hostname to use:** Choose the discovered Name or Serial # hostname format to use for newly discovered devices.  
- **Give precedence to hostname:** Select to force overwrite the existing hostname for devices that already exist using the hostname option.  
- **VRF Group for discovered devices:** Place discovered devices into the following VRF group.  
- **Object Category for discovered devices:** Place discovered objects into the chosen category in Device42.  
- **Overwrite existing object categories:** Select to force overwrite of category on devices that already exist in Device42.

### Device and Chassis Names

If an existing device is not found for the Chassis or the Blade based on the serial number, Device42 will add a new device. The **Name** will be derived from the DN and the serial # of the device.

Check the **Give precedence to hostname** option to use the discovered name for the device instead of its given name.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/hostname-to-use-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/hostname-to-use-19.06-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Service Profiles

Navigate to **Infrastructure > Organization > UCS Service Profiles** to see a list of discovered service profiles. You can view the **Name**, **DN**, **UCSManager**, and **Device** information for each job. 

Search for specific profiles using the search bar on the **Service Profile** page or the main dashboard.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Service profile list"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/service-profile-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/service-profile-19.06-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## Run Now or Schedule

Newly created jobs will not run on the first day of their creation to prevent a large number of unintended jobs from running. To run a job after its initial creation, click on the **Run Now** button on the job details page. You can also run the job from the USC/ACI/Load Balancers for Autodiscovery list page/

<ThemedImage
  alt="Run now button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/ucs-run-now-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/ucs-run-now-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

From the job create and edit modes, you can set one or more schedules for the job by clicking **+ Add another Autodiscovery Schedule**.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cisco-ucs-auto-discovery/ucs-add-autodiscovery-schedule-light.png'),

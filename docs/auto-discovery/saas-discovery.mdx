Device42 SaaS (Software as a Service) discovery finds your organization's SaaS application metadata, application usage, and role-based user assignments by connecting with popular identity providers. 

Gain visibility into your SaaS usage to identify under or overused applications and subscriptions and capture user access details. 

Schedule SaaS discovery to maintain an up-to-date inventory of SaaS information.

## Supported Identity Providers

Device42 currently supports SaaS discovery from the following identity providers:

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- G Suite (Google Workspace)

## SaaS Discovery Items

Device42 SaaS discovery collects the following data:

- SaaS subscription metadata: application name, application ID, discovery source, and account status.
- End users of the SaaS application.
- The last time the SaaS application was used by the end users.
- Role-based permissions and access levels.

Software data collected during SaaS discovery is available under the **Resources > Software Components** section. 

- **[Software components](/infrastructure-management/software/software-components.mdx):** Includes details such as Software Type (**Managed**), License Model (such as **Individual - User/Subscription**), and Vendor.
- **[Software in use](/infrastructure-management/software/software-in-use.mdx):** Includes fields for Version, Install Date, and End User.

Find end user details under **Resources > Organization > End Users**. 

### New and existing End Users

Device42 associates a discovered SaaS subscription with its end user.

During discovery, Device42 compares the email ID of the discovered subscription user with the current End User list to check for a match. If a match is found, the subscription is linked to the existing **End User** as a **Software In Use** item.

If no match is found, a new End User will be created in Device42 with the software association.

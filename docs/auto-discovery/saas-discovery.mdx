Device42 SaaS (Software as a Service) discovery finds your organization's SaaS application metadata, application usage, and role-based user assignments by connecting with popular identity providers. 

Gain visibility into your SaaS usage to identify under- or overused applications and subscriptions and to capture user access details. 

Schedule SaaS discovery to maintain an up-to-date inventory of SaaS information.

## Supported Identity Providers

Device42 currently supports SaaS discovery from the following identity providers:

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- G Suite (Google Workspace)

## SaaS Discovery Items

Device42 SaaS discovery collects the following data:

- SaaS subscription metadata, such as application name, application ID, discovery source, and account status
- End users of the SaaS application
- The last time the SaaS application was used by the end users
- Role-based permissions and access levels

**Software**

Software data collected during SaaS discovery is available under the **Resources > Software Components** section. 

- **[Software Components](/infrastructure-management/software/software-components.mdx):** Includes details such as 
    - **Software Type** (**Managed** or **Unmanaged**)
    - **License Model** (such as **Individual - User/Subscription**)
    - **Vendor**
- **[Software In Use](/infrastructure-management/software/software-in-use.mdx):** Includes fields for
    - **Version**
    - **Install Date**
    - **End User**
    - **Last Login** (30-day tracking period)

**End Users**

You can find the end user discovery data under **Resources > Organization > End Users**. 

### New and Existing End Users

Device42 associates a discovered SaaS subscription with its end user.

During discovery, Device42 compares the email ID of the discovered subscription user with the current End User list to check for a match. If a match is found, the subscription is linked to the existing **End User** as a **Software In Use** item.

If no match is found, Device42 creates a new **End User** with the software association. 

## Create a SaaS Discovery Job

Navigate to **Discovery > SaaS** and click **Create**.

}}
/>

- Name the job and choose which **Remote Collector** to use.
- Select your identity provider (**Azure AD**, **Okta**, or **Gsuite**) from the **Type** dropdown menu.
- Add the authentication credentials for your identity provider account: 
    - Azure AD: **Credential**, **Cloud Definition**, **Tenant ID**, and **Client ID**
    - Okta: **Credential** and **URL**
    - G Suite: **Admin Email** and **Credential**

### Schedule the Job

Create one or more discovery schedules to automatically fetch SaaS data on a regular basis. You can create multiple schedules using the **+ Add New** button.

After saving the job, click the **Run Now** button to start the discovery process right away.

## Generate a Report of the Discovered SaaS Items

The discovered items can be listed as a downloadable Standard or Advanced report. 

For example, you can conveniently select a pre-defined report after at least one SaaS discovery job is run to view the discovered items. Under **Analytics > Reports > Advanced Reporting**, search the available reports for "software" and run the **Software License Management** report.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/saas-discovery/software-license-management-report-dark.png'),

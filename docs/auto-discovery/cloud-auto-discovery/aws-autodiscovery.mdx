Device42's AWS Autodiscovery ensures you have full visibility into your AWS environments. This visibility gives you insights into your total AWS consumption - allowing you optimize on spend and services consumed. We are adding new discoveries all the time, specifically based on customer need.

## Getting Started with AWS Autodiscovery

**To create an AWS Autodiscovery job, you will need to:**

1. Prepare your AWS Account - you can use the policy example shown below.
2. Device42 utilizes your AWS Access Key and Secret Key to perform discovery; please have these handy.

**Note**: Device42 encourages customers to follow AWS best practices for managing your IAM credentials, including using strong passwords, regular password rotation, applying the principle of least privilege to users and their passwords, etc.

For more information, see the article _Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys_ at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/best-practices.html).

### Initiating an AWS Discovery

- Select _Discovery > Cloud_ from the main menu and then click _Add Cloud Autodiscovery_ at the top right of the Cloud Autodiscovery list page.
- Enter a _Name_ for the job.
- Select the _Cloud Type_ > _Amazon AWS_ from the drop-down menu.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-1-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Select the _Remote Collector_ for the job.
- Add your Amazon _Access Key ID_ and your _Secret Key_ for the account(s) to be discovered. (Do this by clicking the magnifying glass, and then clicking _Add Password_ in the upper right corner. Enter your Access Key ID or Secret Key in the field labeled _Password_.  Device42 will store the keys encrypted_._)
- Select _Discover Main Account_ to have the job discover the main AWS account in addition to any AWS Roles accounts you select.
- Select the _Available AWS Roles_ whose account(s) you want to discover and use the arrow to add them to the _Chosen AWS Roles_ list.

**Note:** See [Defining AWS Roles](#addedit-aws-roles) below for instruction for creating the AWS Roles that Devices42 displays for AWS cloud autodiscovery jobs.

- Choose one or more Amazon regions to search.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-2-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


- You can also select options for adding vendor metadata, choose how to  handle instances not found in subsequent discovery vendor, select device name format options, add tags for discovered devices, etc.
- Check _Kubernetes Discovery_ to discover Kubernetes clusters hosted on your cloud platform.
- Check _Extended Summary Discovery_ to discover the full breadth of resources within your AWS Environment. These resources will display in the Cloud Resources section with a limited dataset. 
- Add object categories, tags, and a customer for discovered devices, etc.
- Scroll down the page and click the _Advanced Features (Show)_ tab to select the different types of resources you want the job to discover (Route53, S3, EBS, Databases, etc.).

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-3-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


- Add an _Autodiscovery Schedule_ to schedule the job if wanted or add _Admin Groups_ for the job.
- Click _Save_ or _Save and continue editing_ to save the discovery job.
- When you return to the Cloud Discovery list page, you can click _Run Now_ to run the job immediately.

### Add/Edit AWS Roles

Device42 includes an editor you can use to define or edit the AWS Roles displayed for Amazon AWS cloud autodiscovery jobs. Follow the steps below to view and add AWS Roles.

- Select _Resources > Secrets > AWS Roles_ from the main menu.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Choose AWS Roles menu item"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-4-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-4-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


- Device42 displays the AWS Roles list page. Use the _AWS Role_ drop-down to select a role to display or click _Advanced_ to construct more specific searches. See the [Advanced Search Feature](getstarted/advanced-search-feature.md) documentation page for instructions.

<ThemedImage
  alt="View AWS roles"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-5-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-5-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


- Click _Add_ at the top right to add a new role – click a role _Name_ to view or edit that role.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add a new AWS role"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-6-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-6-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


- Enter a _Name_ for the role.
- Enter the _AWS Role_ label and an optional _AWS Role Description_.
- In the _Account ID and External ID_ section, click _\+ Add More_.
- Add the role _Account ID_ and the _External ID_ – click the eye icon to show or hide the field. Click the trash can icon to remove  the entries.
- Click _Save_ at the top right of the page to save the role.

Device42 adds the new AWS Role to the roles list; it will also appear in the Available AWS Roles list when you create or edit an Amazon AWS cloud autodiscovery job.

**Note:** The following steps are required if you are looking to leverage the AWS switch (Assume) Role on the API calls to scan other AWS accounts

1. From the Main Account:
    
    1. Create a role within IAM -> This should be using the "Another AWS Account" option
        
    2. We would need an account that uses just accountID and one that would be with the Require ExternalID option - Note no requirement for MFA option at this time
        
    3. Policy to be added - use the example minimum policy needed for discovery from our docs site [here](auto-discovery/cloud-auto-discovery/index.mdx)
        
2. From the Sub (or separate)-account
    
    Have a user that is assigned the assumerole from Step 2 "Grant Access to the Role" here in the AWS IAM case [IAM Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html")

### Setting up Dynamic Account Discovery Roles

In 18.11.03, you can now discover all sub accounts and add them to the discovery by using Dynamic Account Discovery. There are a few prerequisite steps that we'll cover first and then get into how to appropriately set up the roles.
1. Create a role with no accounts associated with it
2. Use the role in the discovery with the key/pair associated with it.

Set Up

Option 1:

- Keypair user must be deployed into the org’s root account
- This user policy must have at a minimum the following rights:
    - `sts:assumerole`
    - `organizations:listaccounts`
- A role must be added to all accounts where discovery is desired, with the same role name used in every account where discovery is desired
- The minimum d42 discovery policy must be granted to the role
- For role config within D42, do not add any accounts to the role
- At this time, we cannot use dynamic account discovery to discover roles which use external ID values

Option 2:
- If you don't want to follow the steps above, you can either:
    - make the assumable role available in the main account (dynamic discovery will pull it in if no accounts are listed, or if the main account is included in the manually added list of ID’s), 
    - or also attach the d42 minimum discovery policy to the user directly (requires selection of the “discover main account” box on the job).

## Amazon API Autodiscovery

### Amazon API Discovery Items

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cloud Service/Object Name</strong></td><td><strong>Where to locate in D42</strong></td><td>Accessed API</td><td>Information Generated</td></tr><tr><td>EC2 Instances</td><td>Devices --&gt; All Devices</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Service name, instance ID, OS platform, image ID, Status, etc.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<br/>

When discovering your Amazon Cloud via the Amazon API, Device42 authenticates against the **API URL** with your **AWS API Access Key** and **Secret Key**. To create a discovery job, please ensure you have these available. You can find or generate new AWS API Access keys via the AWS Console -> UserName Menu --> "My Security Credentials". Expand the "Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)" item, and "Create New Access Key" (or reference an existing one): 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Create an access key in AWS"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-8-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-aws-8-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Setting Up an AWS API Discovery Job

<ThemedImage
  alt="Create AWS cloud discovery job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-amazon-api-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/cloud-discovery-aws/cloud-discovery-amazon-api-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

1. Begin by setting **Cloud Type:** ‘Amazon API’ via the dropdown \[pictured\].
2. Enter a "Name" for your Amazon AWS API discovery job.
3. Enter the "URL" of the AWS API endpoint you are targeting, including the port if necessary. For URLs and other information on AWS API endpoints, reference the "Endpoints" section of [the AWS API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html#Using_Endpoints).
4. Add your **AWS API Key ID** to the "API Key" field, followed by the corresponding **Amazon Secret Key** in the "Secret Key" field for the account to be discovered: You'll add both your API Key ID and Secret Key to Device42 as separate 'password' entries, and the procedure is the same as adding a new password: 
    - Click the magnifying glass to bring up the credential selection screen
    - Click the ‘Add Password’ button in the upper right-hand corner
    - Enter your AWS API Key ID in the field labeled “Password:” - _The USERNAME FIELD IS NOT USED by cloud discoveries!_, and click "Save". Repeat the process and add a second entry for your Secret Key, as well. Note that Device42 stores these values encrypted; if desired, you may also set access permissions on your AWS credentials.
5. In the **Region:** box, enter the region you are targeting, e.g. _us-east-1_.
6. Set a discovery schedule if desired; Save and run your AWS API discovery!

**Options for AWS API Discovery:**

- **Action for Instance not found:** Choose how Device42 will handle the situation of an instance that was previously discovered not being found on subsequent discovery runs. Change Status will update the instance's status, while "Delete Instance" will delete the missing instance. The best choice for you depends on how you manage your infrastructure.
- **Strip Domain Name:** Strips the domain name (everything after the first period) from the name as discovered before storing in Device42
- **Object category for discovered devices:** Choose a category to assign to discovered devices
- **Overwrite existing object categories:** Select this option to overwrite any previously assigned categories with the current selection

## Intune Autodiscovery

[Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). An organization can control how its devices (including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops) are used and configure specific policies to control applications.

Intune autodiscovery identifies mobile devices and mobile application software managed by Intune.

:::note
In Device42 19.05, Intune discovery has been adjusted to import devices individually instead of in one large block, which could time out on very large installations.

## Intune Discovery Job Configuration

Before starting the autodiscovery job, ensure that you have an active Intune license.

You also need to make sure you have the application permissions required for a Device42 autodiscovery job. Navigate to the Azure portal and [grant admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/grant-admin-consent) for the following application permissions:

    - `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All`
    - `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
    - `User.Read.All`

Do **not** use delegated credentials for Intune autodiscovery jobs.

### Create a New Intune Discovery Job

<ThemedImage

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/intune-autodiscovery/add-intune-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Select **Intune** from the cloud autodiscovery **Type:** dropdown menu.

Enter a **Name** and **URL** (for example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/[tenant domain or ID]`) for the discovery job.

Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and register an application on the same tenant as Intune. 
- Navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Applications > New Application > Create Your Own Application**. 
- Name your application and select the **Integrate any other application you don’t find in the gallery (Non-gallery)** option.

Once your application has been created: 
- Navigate back to the top-level directory you created the app in and choose **App Registrations**. 
- Select your newly created app and make note of the **Application (client) ID**. This will be used as the **Client ID** in Device42.
- Select **Certificates & Secrets** and then **New Client Secret**. 
- Give your secret an optional description and an expiration date, and select **Add**. 
- Make a  note of the string in the **Value** column, as it will be used as the **Client Credential** for Device42 discovery.

Go back to the Device42 discovery job page:

- Paste the Azure **Client ID** in the discovery job **Client ID** field.
- Paste the Azure **Secret** value in the discovery job **Client Credential** field.

### Configuration Options

Optionally, you can also:

- Select or add a **VRF Group** for the discovered items.
- Select a **Remote Collector** to use for the job.
- Choose to **Overwrite existing device hostname with discovered hostname**.
- Select **Strip Domain Name** to remove the domain name (everything after the first period) from the discovered name.
- Set an **Object category for discovered devices** to assign a specific category to discovered devices.
- Set a job **Service Level** (for example, "Development", "Deployment", or "Production") to apply to the discovered items. See [Service Level and Object Category Options](index.mdx#service-level-and-object-category-options) for details.
- Enter comma-separated **Tags for discovered devices**.
- Select or add a specific **Customer for discovered devices**.
- Set the **Debug level** for the job.
- Choose to **Discover Software** to detect managed software applications.
- Set the **Initial Software Type** for discovered software.
- Set the category of **Intune Device Ownership** to discover "All", "Corporate", or "Personal" devices.
- Enter **Notes** for the job.
- Set the Intune discovery job to run on a regular schedule.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/intune-autodiscovery/schedule-job-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Click **Save** to save the Intune discovery job.

### Intune OS Names

Intune OS data has lower precedence than data from more authoritative sources, like OS-level discovery. For example, the Device42 agent will pick up "Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise" more quickly than the generic Intune name "Windows". The lower precedence ensures more detailed OS names are collected, enhancing the data-filtering capability of the agent.

### Renaming Intune Devices

Devices within Intune are renamed during the build process. If a device name is not updated as expected following Device42 autodiscovery, or after being renamed and updated in Intune, select the **Overwrite existing device hostname with discovered hostname** option.

Workspace ONE Unified Endpoint Management (UEM), formerly known as VMware AirWatch, is supported by Device42 autodiscovery. 

Create and schedule an autodiscovery job to fetch data about the devices and apps managed by your Workspace ONE UEM account and keep your Device42 CMDB updated as a central source of truth.

This page outlines the discovered items and how to set up and run a Workspace ONE UEM (WS1) autodiscovery job.

## Workspace ONE UEM Autodiscovery Items

Currently, the following data is retrieved:

- Computers
- Mobile devices
- IP and MAC addresses
- Installed software and applications

## Create a Workspace ONE Autodiscovery Job

First, create an API key for the user account on the WS1 console.

In Device42, navigate to **Discovery > Cloud** and click **+ Add Cloud Autodiscovery**. 

Under the **Type** dropdown, select **Workspace One**. Provide your account **URL** and paste your WS1 API key in the **Tenant** field.

  }}
/>

### Add Credentials 

Provide your WS1 username and password by creating a secure Secret. Click the **plus icon** next to **Basic credentials** to add a new Secret.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/basic-credentials-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Optional Fields

Choose how to associate vendor metadata to the autodiscovered items. Under **Add device vendor metadata as**, you can specify **Custom Fields**, **Tags**, or **Do Nothing**.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/vendor-metadata-option-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/vendor-metadata-option-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '40%' }} 
/>

Choose an **Object Category for discovered devices**. If you'd like the object category of existing devices to match the newly selected object, check the **Overwrite existing object categories** box. 

Add **Tags for discovered devices** to categorize and later help you filter the discovered devices by your chosen tags.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/additional-options-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Schedule the Autodiscovery Job

You can automate the autodiscovery process by choosing the day(s) and time(s) that the job will run. 

Create multiple jobs using the **+ Add another Autodiscovery Schedule** button.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Schedule job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/job-schedule-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/job-schedule-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Run Now

On saving, you'll have the option to run the job immediately. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Run the job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/run-job-now-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/workspace-one-eum-airwatch/run-job-now-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can also run the job later by navigating back to the **Cloud Autodiscovery** list page and clicking the **Run Now** button next to the job.

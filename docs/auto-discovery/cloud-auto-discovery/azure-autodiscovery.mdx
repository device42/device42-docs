Device42 provides insights into your Azure resources and services by using an application service principal in accordance with [Microsoft’s security recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/secure-least-privileged-access).

This page walks you through the process of creating an application service principal with limited permissions to enable a quick and easy inventory of Azure resources using Device42.

## Get Started with Azure

Before you begin discovery in Device42, prepare your Azure environment. Ensure you've followed the two preparatory steps in your Azure account before you attempt discovery.

### Application Preparation

First, log in to Azure via [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), then navigate to **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Applications > New Application > Create Your Own Application**. Name your application and select the **Integrate any other application you don’t find in the gallery (Non-gallery)** option.

Once your application has been created, navigate back to the top-level directory you created the app in and choose **App Registrations**. Select your newly created app and make note of the **Application (client) ID** and the **Directory (tenant) ID** as these will both be used for Device42 discovery.

Select **Certificates & Secrets**, then **New Client Secret**. Give your secret an optional description and an expiration date. Then, select **Add**. Take note of the string in the **Value** column, as it will be used as the **Client Secret ID** for Device42 discovery, and it will not be visible again once you have signed out of the Azure portal.

### Role Preparation

Device42 lets you discover Azure resources by tenant or subscription level. Tenant discovery is best suited to customers with large numbers of Azure subscriptions. If you only have a few Azure Subscriptions, you may find subscription discovery preferable. 

Please note that the assignable scope in the policy below assumes you are performing subscription-level discovery. 

If you are performing tenant-level discovery, be sure to change the assignable scope to:
`/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/root-management-group-id-goes-here`

#### Subscription Level

The next step is to create a role with limited permissions that will be applied to this application. If you haven't set up your roles yet, see the [Microsoft Assign Azure roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?tabs=delegate-condition) page. The role lets Device42 use the application for discovery purposes, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. 

Navigate to the **Subscriptions** section in the Azure portal and select the subscription you would like to allow this application to discover. Take note of the **Subscription ID**, as it will be used later for Device42 discovery.

:::note
The **Discover all subscriptions** option should be unchecked to enable subscription-level discovery. By default, this option is selected for tenant-level discovery.
:::

Navigate to **Subscriptions > Select your Subscription > Access Control (IAM) >  Roles > Add > Add Custom Role**. Give the custom role a name, and an optional description, then select either **Start from scratch** or **Start from JSON**.

1. If using the **Start from scratch** option, you need to manually select each permission needed for this application to access the desired resources. The permissions needed are available in the Device42 [cloud autodiscovery](auto-discovery/cloud-auto-discovery/index.mdx) documentation. Select **Add permissions**, search for and select the desired permission, check the relevant box, and choose **Add**. Repeat this for any desired permissions.
2. If using the **Start from JSON** option, copy and paste the JSON data below, to pull in the necessary permissions from the list in the Discovery section, and save it as a `.json` file. Upload this file on the **Basics** page when creating the role, and the permissions will be automatically defined.

        "dataActions": [],
        "notDataActions": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Tenant Level

If using the Tenant ID for discovery, you must create a Single Role at the tenant level. Navigate to **Management Groups > Select your Azure Tenant Group > Access Control (IAM) > Roles > Add > Add Custom Role**. Give the custom role a name, and a description, then select **Start from scratch** or 88.

1. If using the **Start from scratch** option, you will need to manually select each permission needed for this application to access the desired resources. Select **Add permissions**, search for and select the desired permission, check the relevant box, and choose **Add**. Repeat this for any desired permissions.
2. If using the **Start from JSON** option, copy and paste the in the JSON data, pulling in the necessary permissions from the list in the Discovery section, and save it as a `.json` file. Be sure to change the assignable scope to `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/root-management-group-id-goes-here`. Then, upload this file on the Basics page when creating the role, and the permissions will be automatically defined.

After defining the permissions, select **Next** to define the scope this application will have access to. You can define the scope at the subscription level or in any of the nested resource groups (this example uses the subscription level). Select **Next** to review or copy the JSON, then **Next** and **Create**.

To apply the role, go back to the **Access Control (IAM) > Add > Add Role Assignment**. Select your newly created role and choose **Next** to bring you to the **Members** tab. Choose the **User, group, or service principal > Select members**, and choose the application created in the previous steps above. Select **Next** and then **Review + Assign**. Your custom role is now applied to your new application and can be used for discovering Azure Resources.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

When **Authentication and Authorization** is set to "Azure AD authentication with Kubernetes RBAC" and **Kubernetes local accounts** is disabled, you must ensure that there is a group configured within the "Cluster admin ClusterRoleBinding" that includes the discovery user/service principal.

It is important to note that you can specify multiple groups within the **Cluster admin ClusterRoleBinding** selection.

This can be useful if you would like to keep the discovery user/service principal in a separate, dedicated discovery group rather than adding it to an existing group.

### Device42 Azure Discovery

Now, you are able to configure an Azure discovery job in Device42 using the application details you noted earlier. The limited role you have applied will prevent access to unnecessary resources, while still allowing for visibility and discovery of what is in scope.

Log in to the Device42 main appliance web console and navigate to **Discovery > Cloud > Add Cloud Autodiscovery**. Give your cloud discovery job a name, select **Microsoft Azure** from the **Cloud Type** dropdown, choose an appropriate remote collector, and select **Service Principal**. The four Azure values you noted earlier will now be used to configure the discovery job.

1. Click the magnifying glass icon for the **Client ID** value and choose **Add Secret** in the window that opens. The username field requires a value, so use it as a label (i.e., Azure Client ID). Next, put the **Application (client) ID** value for the Azure application in the **Password** field. Then, select **Save**.
2. Repeat this process for the **Subscription ID** and **Client Secret** fields, where the **Subscription ID** and **Client Secret ID** values are entered in the respective password fields of their secret entries.
3. The **Directory (tenant) ID** can be pasted directly into the **Tenant ID** field of the discovery job.

You can set the **Service Level** of the job to be applied to the discovered items. See the [service level and object category options](index.mdx#service-level-and-object-category-options) for details.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/add-azure-secret-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**Here, you also have the option to configure any other discovery options as you require:**

- You can add vendor metadata as tags or custom fields, edit device name format, and enable Kubernetes discovery to pull in AKS resources.
- Every **Vendor** is user-defined. Device42 does not ship with a list of vendors.
- If a **VRF Group** is selected, all discovered IPs will be placed in subnets in that VRF group. This is useful if you have duplicate IPs in your internal network.
- If you choose a **Remote Collector**  to run a job, ensure the chosen remote collector can reach the target network.
- By default, Azure discovery is set to **Discover all subscriptions** for tenant-level discovery.
- When **Discover all subscriptions** is unchecked, you can manually discover a subscription using its **Subscription ID**.
- Select the **Device Name Format** for discovered cloud instances.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device Name Format"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/device-name-format-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/device-name-format-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Select **Kubernetes Discovery** to discover Kubernetes clusters hosted on your cloud platform.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Kubernetes Discovery"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/k8s-discovery-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/k8s-discovery-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
/>

<ThemedImage
  alt="Kubernetes Discovery not found"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/k8s-not-found-action-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/k8s-not-found-action-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '70%' }} 
/>

- Check **Extended Summary Discovery** to discover all resources within your Azure environments. Summary Discovery will bring in all resources, with abbreviated detail.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Extended Summary Discovery"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/extended-summary-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/extended-summary-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '60%' }} 
/>

- Check **Add tags as custom fields** to add discovered tags to Device42 custom fields.
- Check **Strip domain name** to have Device42 strip the discovered domain suffix (everything after the first period) from the device instance name.
- Choose a category for discovered devices (note that categories are user-defined).

The **Advanced Features** section enables the discovery of database and function resources. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Advanced Features section"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/advanced-features-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/azure-autodiscovery/advanced-features-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Next, click **Save and Continue**. Then, you can **Run** the job immediately, or you can save it and have it run on a regular schedule.

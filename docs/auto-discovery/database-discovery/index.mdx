## About Database Discovery

Database (DB) discovery was introduced in Device42 v16.02.00 and currently supports Windows and \*nix-based discovery jobs detecting Microsoft SQL (aka MSSQL), Oracle, Postgres SQL, and DB2 databases.

:::note
Database discovery requires an **Application Dependency Mapping** license. Go to **Tools > Settings > Licensing** to see if the license is enabled. Contact [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com) for licensing assistance.
:::

By default, the target machine ports are defined by the database vendors as follows:

- Microsoft SQL (MSSQL): 1433
- IBM DB2: 50000
- Postgres: 5432
- Oracle: 1521

Dynamic discovery detects which ports to use. As of v16.17.00, Device42 supports MSSQL and Oracle database discovery for customers with database instances configured to listen on non-standard ports, especially on shared database servers that host multiple instances. During database discovery, Device42 will identify and connect via the discovered active listening port.

If you want to specify database discovery details yourself, including the database server port, server IP address, and database access credentials, use [Database Connections Discovery](#database-connections-discovery-jobs) jobs (see below) to discover databases.

### Discovery Exclusions

Set discovery exclusions in **Tools > Settings > Global Settings** in the **Discovery Exclusions** section.

If you enable the **Ignore DB Login Names** setting, database login names will not be collected during database discovery.

You can also specify interfaces, IP addresses, and MAC addresses to be ignored during discovery. 

## MSSQL Server Database Discovery (on Windows Targets)

MSSQL server discovery is supported on discovery targets running Microsoft Windows, although it requires a separate set of credentials to authenticate to the database instance itself. Ensure the discovery credentials have appropriate permissions to view the databases you are interested in discovering.

Device42 supports autodiscovery on Windows and \*nix platforms for the following MSSQL versions:

- MSSQL 2005
- MSSQL 2008
- MSSQL 11 on SQL Server 2012
- MSSQL 12 on SQL Server 2014
- MSSQL 13 on SQL Server 2016
- MSSQL 14 on SQL Server 2017
- Cluster MSSQL 12

### Minimum Permissions Requirements for MSSQL Discovery

To query the tables below, please ensure you have **View Server State** permissions. For the discovery to return detailed information about your database instance, you need read permissions to the following system views:

<table><tbody><tr><td width="288"><ul><li>`sys.dm_exec_connections`</li><li>`sys.dm_exec_sessions`</li><li>`sys.databases`</li><li>`sys.master_files`</li></ul></td><td width="288"><ul><li>`sys.tables`</li><li>`sys.dm_os_sys_info`</li><li>`sys.dm_os_sys_memory`</li><li>`sys.all_objects`</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

The following snippet is necessary for retrieving data from some of the preceding views, such as `sys.master_files`, even when the user has read permissions enabled:

```sql
USE [master];
GO
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [discovery_user];
GO
```

**Note**: The discovery user must belong to the administratorâ€™s user group to discover databases successfully.

### Set Up Your MSSQL Discovery Job

Create a new Windows discovery job under **Discovery > HyperVisors /\*nix /Windows** to discover MSSQL databases running on Windows. 

Enable database discovery by checking the **Collect database server information** checkbox. 

<ThemedImage
alt="MS SQL discovery job"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/new-sql-discovery-job-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/new-sql-discovery-job-dark.png'),
}}
/>

Be sure to fill out both sets of credentials:

- **Database Username / Password(s):** Credentials for authenticating to the Microsoft SQL database itself.
- **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s):** Credentials for authenticating to the Windows server.

Two sets of credentials must also be filled out for [regular Windows-based discovery targets](/auto-discovery/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery.mdx).

You can enter an ordered list of preferred **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s)**. When the job runs, it will use the credentials in the order that you entered them, stopping at the first successful authentication. Subsequent job runs use the last successful credential and then the remaining credentials in the ordered list.

<ThemedImage
alt="Discovery Credentials order"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/discovery-targets-credentials-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/discovery-targets-credentials-dark.png'),
}}
/>

Run the autodiscovery job to test it by clicking **Run Now** from the autodiscovery jobs list.

As MSSQL databases are detected, discovery will import a list of all the instances, databases, and connection details it finds.

You can see the status of the discovery job on the job setup page. Scroll down to the **Job Status** section and look for the bar graphs.

![Example job status](/assets/images/discovery-job-status-trimmed.png)

### View Your MSSQL Discovery Job Results

Once the job finishes, there are multiple ways to view the results of your database discovery. 

#### Access Your Results Through the Discovered MSSQL Application Components

The most direct method for viewing the discovered database details is via the discovered MSSQL application components themselves. 

Navigate to the Device42 main menu and go to **Applications > Application Components**. If you don't see your SQL Server instances at the top of the list, you can search for "SQL" to narrow down the list.

You can see the newly discovered SQL Server instances in the example below. Click on the **Name** of one of the application components to view more details.

<ThemedImage
alt="Application Components list page"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/application-components-search-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/application-components-search-dark.png'),
}}
/>

Scroll to the **Application Components** section at the bottom of the page and click the database instance name to view database details.

<ThemedImage
alt="MSSQL example"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/mssql-example-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/mssql-example-dark.png'),
}}
/>

<ThemedImage
alt="MSSQL example of database instances"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/mssql-db-instances-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/mssql-db-instances-dark.png'),
}}
/>

For a rundown of the database details that discovery provides, jump to the [**Available SQL Database Instance Information**](#available-sql-database-instance-information) section.

#### Access Your Results Using the Continuous Integration (CI) of a Discovered Windows Server Instance

You can also view the discovered database details by navigating to the CI of your discovered Windows server instance.

Either search for the device from the dashboard, via **Devices > All Devices**, navigate to your discovery job results page and access the servers from there, or go to **Analytics > Discovery Scores** and search for your discovery job. 

![](/assets/images/click-success-for-discovery-scores.png)

Click any of the **Object** names to view the details of the discovered machine. 

<ThemedImage
alt="Discovery Scores view"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/discovery-scores-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/discovery-scores-dark.png'),
}}
/>

From the details view, open the **Services** tab to view a list of services, and click on the MSSQL Server instance in the **Service Detail** list.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/services-tab-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/services-tab-dark.png'),
}}
/>

### Available SQL Database Instance Information

The page displaying the database details includes lists that contain the following:

- The **Resource Details** of the MSSQL database, including the **SQL Server Start Time** and memory stats.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Resource Details"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/resource-details-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/resource-details-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- The **Database/Schema** of the instance. You can click on each database for more details.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Database/Schema"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/database-schema-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/database-schema-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- The **Database Instance Files**, including the **Creation Date** and **Path** for each resource.
  
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Database Instance Files"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/db-instance-files-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/db-instance-files-dark.png'),
    }}
    />    

- The **Endpoints and Network Details**.
  
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Endpoints and Network Details"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/endpoints-network-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/endpoints-network-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

If your environment includes SQL cluster databases, discovery returns the following information about the clusters:

- SQL Cluster name
- SQL Cluster Node Role
- Is Node Active or Read-Replica
- Does Passive Node use Log Ship
- Does Passive Node use DB Mirroring

## Oracle Database Discovery (on Windows and \*nix targets)

Oracle database discovery (introduced in v16.04.00) is supported for Windows and \*nix discovery targets. Oracle discovery jobs require a separate set of credentials to authenticate to the database instance itself. Ensure these additional credentials have the appropriate permissions for viewing the databases you want to discover.

As of v16.14.01, Device42 now supports autodiscovery on Windows and \*nix platforms for the following Oracle database versions:

**Oracle 10g**

- Windows 32 bit
- CentOS 32 bit

**Oracle 11g**

- Windows 32 bit
- Windows 64 bit
- CentOS 32 bit
- CentOS 64 bit

**Oracle 12c**

- Windows 64 bit
- CentOS 64 bit

**Oracle 18c**

- CentOS 64 bit
- Windows 64 bit

**Oracle 19c**

- Windows 64 bit
- CentOS 7 64 bit

As of v16.17.00, Device42 database autodiscovery for Windows and \*nix targets supports discovery for Oracle RAC clustered database environments, which helps users better assess their cluster databases and understand all The IT assets tied to critical business applications. Discovery returns data about the RAC configuration, the RAC database, and the nodes (physical servers) running the RAC software. You can run the autodiscovery against one or more nodes in the Oracle RAC and return information about all connected nodes. Device42 requires the use of sudo for Oracle discoveries to mitigate the risk of lockout.

### Minimum Permissions Requirements for Oracle Discovery

For discovery to return detailed info about your database instance, you will require read or view permissions for the following system views and tables:

<table><tbody><tr><td width="288"><ul><li>V$SESSION</li><li>V$DATABASE</li><li>V$CONTAINERS</li><li>DBA_SEGMENTS</li></ul></td><td width="288"><ul><li>DBA_OBJECTS</li><li>SYS.ALL_USERS</li><li>DATABASE_COMPATIBLE_LEVEL</li><li>SYS.PRODUCT_COMPONENT_VERSION</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

To get information about pluggable databases (PDBs) within an Oracle container database (CDB), two key permission configurations are required for non-DBA users:

- SELECT permission on the V$CONTAINERS view.
- Set `container_data=all container=current` for context configuration. For example:

    ```sql
    ALTER USER c##<username>
    SET
    CONTAINER_DATA = ALL
    CONTAINER = CURRENT;
    ```

### Set Up Your Oracle Discovery Job

To begin discovering your Oracle databases, navigate to **Discovery > HyperVisors /\*nix /Windows**. Create a new discovery job for Windows or \*nix (or both) targets, and be sure to check the **Collect database server information** checkbox.

<ThemedImage
alt="Add Oracle DB Discovery job"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/oracle-job-basics-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/oracle-job-basics-dark.png'),
}}
/>

Be sure to fill out both sets of credentials:

- **Database Username / Password(s)** to authenticate to the Oracle database. 
- **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s)** to authenticate to the Windows or *nix server.

You can enter an ordered list of preferred **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s)** when you create a database discovery job. When the job runs, it will use the credentials in the order that you entered them, stopping at the first successful authentication. Subsequent job runs use the last successful credential and then the remaining credentials in the ordered list.

### Oracle CDB/PDB Matching Process and Regular Processing Procedures

An Oracle database instance is created for each CDB and PDB, even in cases where they share the same endpoint listener.

Whenever possible, each root database instance (CDB) will be matched with the same endpoint as the incoming resource (CDB or PDB). If a root database instance (CDB) is found, the discovery attempts to locate all related child databases (PDBs) and iterates through all of the child records. If any child database name matches the name of the incoming resource, the child DB is identified as the same as the incoming DB, and the existing record is updated with the new incoming resource data.

If no child database instance resources are found, the resource is matched to the root resource. The discovery only proceeds according to regular processing if there is no match with any root resources.

Orphaned PDBs aren't matched to the root CDB if a fresh CDB is incoming.

If a candidate database instance is identified as a child of a CDB, it skips the matching process.

## Postgres SQL Database Discovery (on \*nix targets)

From v17.11.00 onward, Device42 offers Postgres SQL database discovery for \*nix discovery targets, although it requires a separate set of credentials to authenticate to the database instance itself. Ensure these additional credentials have the appropriate permissions for viewing the databases you are interested in discovering.

### Minimum Permissions Requirements for Postgres SQL Discovery

For discovery to return detailed information about your database instance, you will need access to the following tables:

* `pg_database`
* `pg_tablespace`
* `pg_stat_activity`
* `init_server_addr` (function)

### Set Up Your Postgres SQL Discovery Job

To begin discovering your Postgres SQL databases, create a new discovery job for \*nix targets, and be sure to enable database discovery by checking the **Collect database server information** checkbox.

Fill out both sets of credentials:

- **Database Username / Password(s):** These credentials are used to authenticate to the Postgres database. 
- **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s):** These credentials are used to authenticate to the \*nix server.

<ThemedImage

sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/postgres-job-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/database-discovery/postgres-job-dark.png'),
}}
/>

You can enter an ordered list of preferred **Discovery Target(s) Credential(s)** when you create a database discovery job. When the job runs, it will use the credentials in the order that you entered them, stopping at the first successful authentication. Subsequent job runs use the last successful credential and then the remaining credentials in the ordered list.

## Database Connections Discovery Jobs

Device42 v18.01.00 adds a new database discovery job type for discovering information about the databases in your environment. Database discovery is based on the database connection information, such as the application components and DB server details, that you supply for the job. Returned database information is added to the **On-Prem Databases** list page.

This database discovery job type is useful when the main detailed database discovery (in OS jobs) cannot determine the proper connection settings for a specific database, because the database connection discovery job instead uses a string containing connection settings provided by the user.

:::note
If you have already discovered cloud databases using cloud autodiscovery jobs when you perform a database connections discovery using FQDN, Device42 will not duplicate the databases (which was the previous behavior).

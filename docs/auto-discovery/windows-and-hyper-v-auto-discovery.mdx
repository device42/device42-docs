Device42 discovery uses multiple protocols to communicate with the target devices. Either WinRM or WMI can be used for Windows discovery. As of 18.10.00, WMI is the default protocol. 

## Prerequisites

When using WMI, you need to install the Windows Discovery Service (WDS) and connect to your Remote Collectors (RCs) before setting up your Windows discovery job. For WDS installation instructions and information, visit the [Windows Discovery Service Installation](/getstarted/installation/windows-discovery-service-installation.mdx) documentation.

### WinRM Network Requirements

WinRM uses port 5985 (HTTP) or 5986 (HTTPS), depending on the configuration of the target host. These connections come from the RC selected at the top of the jobs page. For configuration within your environment, please refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/installation-and-configuration-for-windows-remote-management). Note that you must enable WinRM on your Windows machines, which can be configured through a Group Policy Object (GPO).

### WMI Network Requirements

WMI is based on DCOM/RPC. This means a connection is first initiated on port 135 to determine what dynamic port to use. The connection then proceeds to use the dynamic port negotiated. The following [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/connecting-to-wmi-remotely-starting-with-vista) can be used for configuring WMI.

### Network Issues

Our support team can provide best-effort assistance in resolving issues. However, for both protocols, it is best to reach out to your network or system admin to resolve connection issues.

## Discovered Information

Provided with a successful configuration of the discovery account, and given the data's availability, Device42 will gather the following information:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="20%">
                <ul>
                    <li>Device host information</li>
                    <li>Parts</li>
                    <li>Operating System</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td width="25%">
                <ul>
                    <li>Service processes</li>
                    <li>Software installed</li>
                    <li>Installed common applications and configuration files</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Within the **Parts** section of device details, the CPU, RAM, and storage entries for the device will be displayed. You may also see additional information such as model number, slot, and location.

## Creating and Running Windows Discovery Jobs

Navigate to **Discovery > HyperVisors / \*Nix / Windows** to set up and save multiple autodiscovery jobs for Windows, Hyper-V, and other platforms.

<ThemedImage
alt="Windows and Hyper-V menu"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/list-page-menu-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/list-page-menu-dark.png'),
}}
/>

1. Click the **Create** button to set up a new Windows or Hyper-V autodiscovery job.
2. For Windows or Hyper-V discovery, select **Windows** as the **Platform**.
    - You can select **Discover Using WinRM** to use the WinRM protocol for discovery, which is fast and Microsoft's preferred protocol. The **URL prefix** and **Port** fields will default accordingly. 
    :::note 
    We don't deem it necessary to update existing jobs to use WinRM, as we currently use NTLM, which Microsoft is in the process of deprecating. We'll use Kerberos in the near future.
    :::
    - If you're using WinRM, we recommend selecting the **WinRM through WDS** option to run the discovery using the local WDS. Ensure that your WDS service account operates under a domain account and is not set to "Local System", as it doesn't support remote authentication.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Windows and Hyper-V Job"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/winrm-job-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/winrm-job-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

3. Click **Add another Username/Password** to add one or more sets of credentials for the autodiscovery targets.
   
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Add credentials"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/credentials-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/credentials-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

\***Classic WinRM** is no longer a Platform type as of 18.08.00. Existing Classic WinRM jobs will continue to function.

### Windows and Hyper-V discovery Options

- **Job Name:** Provide a unique name for the job.

- **Remote Collector:** Select which RC you’d like to run the discovery job from.

- **Job Debug Level:** Select **Debug On** to collect extra debug info that's useful for support tickets.

- **Discovery Target(s):** Specify the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP of the discovery target(s). If using FQDN, Device42 must be configured to resolve the DNS.

- **Use Service Account Credentials:** Use the currently logged-in user of the system running WDS to perform WMI discovery.

- **Query domain controller to obtain a list of discovery devices:** Select this to hide the Discovery Target(s) field. Target(s) discovered in this mode are instead defined by the result of the chosen LDAP Criteria, as returned by the specified Microsoft Windows Active Directory Domain or Domain Directory Server. See the [Query domain controller](#query-domain-controller-to-obtain-list-of-discovery-devices-option) section below.

- **Collect database server information:** Select this option to discover Oracle, MSSQL, DB2, and Postgres database servers, and display a **Database Username/Password(s)** field. 

- **ADM Sampling Interval:** Turn **Off** or add the sampling interval in minutes or hours.

- **Enable Resource Utilization Tracking for Device(s):** Optionally enable the collection of resource utilization metrics from discovered devices.

- **Resource Utilization Sampling Interval:** Set the interval for RU data collection (only in effect if RU Tracking is enabled).

- **Autodiscovery Schedule:** You can [schedule the discovery](#scheduling-autodiscovery-jobs) to run at certain times.

### Options To Ignore IPs and MAC Addresses

You can ignore IP and MAC addresses to exclude them from our database during autodiscovery. Devices with these addresses will still be discovered but the detailed information that is typically stored and collected will be ignored.

When creating or editing a job, you can configure rules to ignore IP and MAC addresses for that specific job.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Ignore IPs and MACs"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/ip-mac-ignore-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/ip-mac-ignore-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Globally, you can add an **Exclusion** to ignore IP and MAC addresses for all jobs by navigating to **Tools > Settings > Global Settings** on the Main Appliance (MA).

### The “Query domain controller to obtain list of discovery devices” Option

Selecting the **Query domain controller to obtain list of discovery devices** option hides the **Server(s):** field. Target(s) discovered in this mode are instead defined by the result of the chosen **LDAP Criteria**, as returned by the specified Microsoft Windows Active Directory Domain or Domain Directory Server.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Query domain LDAP filter"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/query-domain-filter-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/query-domain-filter-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

The relevant fields when using this discovery mode are as follows:

- **Use Service Account Credentials**: Use whatever account credentials the WDS service executing the discovery is running as for authentication.

- **Domain Server:** Hostname or IP address of the Active Directory server to run the LDAP query against.

- **LDAP username/password:** Authentication credentials used to execute the LDAP query against the specified domain controller/server.

- **Use FQDN:** Use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

- **LDAP Criteria:** Choose an LDAP query to execute against the Active Directory (AD). The resultant list will then be targeted for Windows autodiscovery. Select **Custom** to specify a custom LDAP filter or query.


**LDAP Query Example: Query Domain Controller**

The following query will search the domain server for all computers with DNS hostname `d42sus.pvt` and autodiscover the matches:

```
(&(objectCategory=computer)(dNSHostName=d42sus.pvt))
```

### Discovery with Microsoft LAPS 

Microsoft Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS) is a method of securing AD member servers that randomly generates a server's local admin password and stores it as an attribute of that server's AD object in AD. 

This password can then be looked up on demand via an AD LDAP query and is often used to support scripted actions that iterate through lists of AD member servers. 

**Resources:**

- If you want to install LAPS, visit the [Microsoft LAPS download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899). 
- For more information, see [the Microsoft security advisory article about LAPS](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-security-advisory-local-administrator-password-solution-laps-now-available-may-1-2015-404369c3-ea1e-80ff-1e14-5caafb832f53).
- If you'd like to deploy LAPS, you might find the [Deploying LAPS guide](https://flamingkeys.com/deploying-the-local-administrator-password-solution-part-1/) helpful.

Device42 supports pulling credentials from LAPS when discovering AD domain member servers that use Microsoft LAPS to manage their local admin passwords. You will see this option **only** when you have checked **Query domain controller to obtain list of discovery devices**. Once checked, you will see **Use LAPS (only Applies to WDS)**.

Check the **Use LAPS (only Applies to WDS)** checkbox to enable it: 


<ThemedImage
    alt="Use LAPS option"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/use-laps-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/use-laps-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Fields and requirements for using LAPS discovery mode:

1. Check the **Query domain controller to obtain list of discovery devices** option.
2. Specify your domain server.
3. Specify an LDAP username-and-password credential combination with permission to query the LAPS password for each server.
4. You must have at least one instance of WDS installed (a requirement for all Windows-based discoveries).
5. Choose **All Computers** or **All Servers** from the **LDAP Criteria** dropdown, or optionally supply your own custom LDAP query by selecting **Custom Filter** from the dropdown.
6. Run your discovery job.

## Additional Job Options

After completing the required options for your Windows or Hyper-V discovery, scroll down the discovery job page to see additional job options, including **Exclusions**, **Naming**, **Host Discovery**, **Hypervisor Options**, **Software and Applications**, and **Miscellaneous** options. Click **Show** to expand those options.

### Host Discovery Options

Expand the **Host Discovery** section to configure different types of hosts, what information to collect, and how to handle data during the discovery process.

Enabling the **Discover ProviderID/CloudID** option reveals the **Provider Token** option, which might be needed for authentication with the cloud service provider.

<ThemedImage
alt="Host Discovery options"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/host-discovery-options-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/host-discovery-options-dark.png'),
}}
/>

### Scheduling Autodiscovery Jobs

In the **Autodiscovery Schedule** section, you can set as many different autodiscovery schedules as you need to cover your environment. You can choose specific times and days of the week to run the autodiscovery job.

<ThemedImage
alt="Autodiscovery schedule"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/autodiscovery-schedule-light-2.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/autodiscovery-schedule-dark-2.png'),
}}
/>

### Job Status and Run Report

The **Job Status** section contains information about the last run status of the autodiscovery job.

The **Job Run Report** has summary diagnostic details of `stderr` and `stdout` for the last discovery job.

<ThemedImage
alt="Job Status example report"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/job-status-stderr-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/job-status-stderr-dark.png'),
}}
/>

## Device Naming and Duplicate Device Prevention

To prevent or correct any duplicate devices, you can control the format for the names of devices added. For example, if you're running a VMWare discovery in tandem with a Windows discovery, there may be differences in discovered device names. vSphere will often show the short hostname, but a WMI query against the OS will return server FQDNs.

Device42 tries to best match devices by serial number, UUID, and then name. However, if duplicates are added, you can  use the options detailed in the following section to correct them.

### Configuring Windows Hostname Discovery Details

From the **Naming Options** section of the autodiscovery job, select the **Strip domain suffix** option to drop everything after the first `.` in the device name.

The **strip domain suffix** setting works in conjunction with the **Device Name Format** setting.

Under the **Device Name Format** dropdown, you can add or update the **Device Name** of any targets with the hostname format of your choosing. The naming options are as follows:

- **Hostname as Discovered**
- **Hostname plus Domain Name**
- **Hostname and add Hostname plus Domain Name as Alias**
- **Hostname plus Domain Name and add Hostname as Alias**

<ThemedImage
alt="Hostname options"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/naming-config-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/naming-config-dark.png'),
}}
/>

If your server hostnames are consistently named as you'd like them to appear, select the **Hostname as Discovered** option. 

In environments with inconsistent naming conventions, select **Strip domain suffix** and **Hostname plus domain Name**. The options work together to strip the hostnames to short names and then append the found domains to those names.

If your server hostnames include domain names, such as `server1.domain.com`, and you **do not** strip the domain name suffix and choose the **Hostname plus Domain Name** option, the domain name will be appended again, resulting in names like `server1.domain.com.domain.com`. 

Choose the **Hostname and add Hostname plus Domain Name as Alias** to add the discovered name as an alias, rather than replacing an existing device's name. This option adds devices using the discovered hostname as the device name, and the FQDN as the alias. 

:::note
To set the **Device Name** to the FQDN of the device, make sure you select an option that includes **Hostname plus Domain Name**.
:::

### The Windows Hostname Discovery Process

Device42 uses the following WMI query to obtain host and domain details on Windows servers:

```sql
SELECT DNSHostName, Name, Manufacturer, Model, TotalPhysicalMemory, Domain, DomainRole 
FROM Win32_ComputerSystem
```

We use the results of the query as follows:

For the **Device Name**, we first look at the `DNSHostName`, then at the `Name` field (if `DNSHostName` is empty).

If the `DomainRole` value is one of the following, we use the `Domain` value for the **Domain Name**:

- `WinDomainRoles.MemberWorkstation`
- `WinDomainRoles.MemberServer`
- `WinDomainRoles.PrimaryDomainController`
- `WinDomainRoles.BackupDomainController`

### Hyper-V Discovery

To run a Hyper-V discovery job, set the **Platform** to **Windows**, and enable the **Discover VMs** option.

The Hyper-V server's hardware details, name, UUID, and MAC addresses are pulled in from the VMs. In the **Server(s)** field, be sure to include the Hyper-V servers as hostnames, as IP addresses, or as part of the CIDR/IP Range.

## Permission Requirements for WMI and Windows

Windows permissions requirements are broken down into two parts that are detailed in the sections below:

- Minimum required permissions for discovering **Windows hosts/guests information**.
- Minimum required permissions for discovering the **services and application data** for [Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)](/reports/dbb-cookbook/app-dependency-mapping.mdx) on Windows. 

WinRM-specific items are listed where applicable, but the permissions themselves must be enabled on the target machine.

### Windows WMI Autodiscovery Minimum Permissions

The following requirements represent the minimum user account permissions to allow Device42 to connect and discover a Windows host.

1. Ensure that at least **Enable Account**, **Remote Enable**, **Read Security**, and **WMI permissions** are applied to the autodiscovery user account and to the following WMI namespaces and sub-namespaces:

    <table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td width="20%">
            <ul>
            <li><code>CIMV2</code></li>
            <li><code>StandardCimv2</code></li>
            <li><code>default</code></li>
            <li><code>virtualization</code> <small>(Hyper-V only)</small></li>
            <li><code>virtualizationv2</code> <small>(Hyper-V only)</small></li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td width="25%">
            <ul>
            <li><code>MicrosoftIISv2</code> <small>(Only for IIS)</small></li>
            <li><code>WebAdministration</code> <small>(Only for IIS 7+)</small></li>
            <li><code>MicrosoftSqlServer</code> <small>(Only for SQL Server)</small></li>
            <li><code>SMS</code> <small>(Only for SCCM)</small></li>
            <li><code>MSCluster</code> <small>(Only used if 'Discover Cluster Information' is selected)</small></li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

:::note 
For Hyper-V discovery against Windows Server2k12 and newer: Because Microsoft verifies permissions differently on these newer operating systems, you may need to add your Device42 discovery account to the built-in Hyper-V administrators group if discovery fails due to a permissions error.
:::

2. Enable the following firewall rules:

    **WinRM**
    - HTTP (5985)
    - HTTPS (5986)

    **WMI**
    - Windows Management Instrumentation (DCOM-In)
    - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI-In)

3. Enable the following services and set them to automatic:

   - Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
   - Windows Management Instrumentation

4. Ensure the discovery user account is a member of the **Performance Monitor Users Group** and **Distributed COM Users Group** on the machines targeted for discovery.

:::info 
If you discover servers that do not belong to a domain, your User Account Control (UAC) settings may be causing issues. Please refer to this [MSDN article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/user-account-control-and-wmi?redirectedfrom=MSDN) to learn more about the effect of UAC on WMI.
:::

### Windows ADM Minimum Permissions

There are two options for configuring ADM permissions for admin users. The first option uses local administrative permissions and the `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares. The second option lets users configure their own shares.

For the local administrator method:

1. ADM requires the local admin group on the target hosts and access to `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares.
2. Enable access to `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares: Device42 will utilize the `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares to obtain service port communication details in Windows discovery. Ensure these shares are enabled and accessible over port 445, or inter-device communications will not be discovered.
3. Connection data is written to a path on the `admin$` administrative share, which is only writable by the local admin group. This path is used because it is a standard, consistent path that can be found on all Windows deployments.

For the alternate method:

If the `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares are inaccessible when setting up the discovery job, you can now use a network share. 

1. Specify a share. It can be local to the device or a shared location on your network.
2. Give the scanning account read and write privileges to the new shared location.
3. ADM also requires local admin permissions for this method.

<ThemedImage
alt="Windows Share field"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/windows-share-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/windows-share-dark.png'),
}}
/>

While it's best to use an admin account for complete discovery, you can try the following workaround to grant a non-admin user permission for service discovery. 

Use the `sc.exe sdset scmanager` command to grant `SC_MANAGER_CONNECT` permission to the user:

- First, [find the SID](https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/how-to-find-user-security-identifier/) of the non-admin user account that you want to grant permission. 

- Next, as an admin user, add the non-admin user's SID to the following command and execute it in PowerShell:

    ```bash
    sc.exe sdset scmanager "D:(A;;CC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;IU)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SU)(A;;CCLCRPWPRC;;;SY)(A;;KA;;;BA)(A;;CC;;;AC)(A;;CCLCRPRC;;;SID_OF_DISCOVERY_USER)"
    ```

- Then try running the discovery process again as the non-admin user.

## Best Practices and Limitations

- If you've populated Device42 with devices before your first discovery run (using CSV imports, spreadsheets, or manual entry), be sure to test discovery against a few devices to check that the selected discovery naming options are correct for your naming convention. For example, if you added `nh-linux01` as a device, autodiscovery could find the hostname `nh-linux01.example.com` and add it as a new device because the names don't match. See the [Device Naming and Duplicate Device Prevention](#device-naming-and-duplicate-device-prevention) section.
- It's best to **run device autodiscovery after running network autodiscovery** or after defining the subnets where your network IPs reside.
- Floating IPs that logically belong to a cluster but are found on a device during autodiscovery will be assigned to that device and **not** the cluster resource.
- You can run the WDS from any or multiple network segments. Communication from the autodiscovery client back to the main Device42 instance requires access via port TCP/443 (HTTPS) to be allowed on your network.

## Legacy Windows 2000 Discovery Prerequisites

If you are looking to discover a legacy Windows 2000-based operating system, a few OS settings need to be tweaked on the machine hosting your WDS to obtain proper results:

1. Change or create the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\LmCompatibilityLevel` element so that it has the value `1`.
2. Change the WDS service user from `System` to one of the host users (like an admin account). You can try to run a discovery job without this step, but users report failure without making this change.

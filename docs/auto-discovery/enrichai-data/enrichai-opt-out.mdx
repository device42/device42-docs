EnrichAI Data is a Device42 service to enrich discovered data – currently Device42 supports enrichment of discovered device OS data and Vendor data – additional data types will be added in future releases. This section details the steps to take if you choose to disable this enrichment service. Please note that if you re-discover data that was previously enriched, then you will lose that data until you opt back into the EnrichAI cloud service.

 

Select _Tools > Cloud Services_ to display the Cloud Services page.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/cloud-services-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/cloud-services-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You can see the status of your cloud services from this view. In this example EnrichAI is currently Enabled.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/view-integration-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

To disable this feature, you will click the _Edit_ button in the bottom right corner of the screen.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Edit Button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/edit-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/edit-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
Once the _Edit_ button has been selected, you will see the option to disable the EnrichAI service highlighted below.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Disable Button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/disable-button-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/disable-button-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Select the action you would like which in this example is to _Disable._

<ThemedImage
  alt="Disable prompt"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/prompt-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/prompt-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

_EnrichAI_ will show as being _Disabled_. Select _Save_ in the bottom right to save your changes.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Save button"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/disabled-save-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enrichai-opt-out/disabled-save-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

If you would like to opt back into the EnrichAI service, then you will follow the same steps to enable. Once re-enabled we recommend to re-run your discovery jobs to ensure that your data is enriched.

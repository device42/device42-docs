Microsoft Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a service provided by the Microsoft Windows Server operating system. DHCP is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters, like the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers, to devices on a network.

If you already use Microsoft DHCP Servers in your environment, Microsoft DHCP Discovery will automatically populate records of discovered DHCP Servers, IP Addresses, and subnets; including additional DHCP details like DHCP Scope, State, Lease Duration, DNS information, Start and End address ranges. 

## Discovery

Microsoft DHCP Discovery uses WMI by default, but WinRM is also supported and can be optionally enabled in the job configuration.

:::note
If **Discovery Using WinRM** is not enabled, pair a WDS with the selected Remote Collector to use WMI.

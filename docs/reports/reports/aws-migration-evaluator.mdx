You can generate a Device42 AWS Migration Evaluator report from Device42â€™s predefined reports and upload the report to the AWS Migration Evaluator portal. To see a sample report, see the [AWs Migration Business Case](https://d1.awsstatic.com/asset-repository/tso-logic/MigrationEvaluator_TSOLogic_AWS_BusinessCaseSample.pdf).

To generate the report, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to **Insights+** via the header menu.

2. Select **Advanced Reports > Integrations > Total Cost of Ownership > AWS Migration Evaluator**.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Insights menu"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/aws-migration-evaluator/insights-menu-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/aws-migration-evaluator/insights-menu-dark.png'),
    }}
    />  

3. Download each tab of the report into separate **CSV** files.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Download charts"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/aws-migration-evaluator/download-charts-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/aws-migration-evaluator/download-charts-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

4. Combine the CSV files into a single `.xlsx` file for consumption by AWS. Each tab should be named to match its data.

Migration Evaluator will provide console access to the customer so you can securely upload the data to us for processing.

Before you upload the Device42 report, you may want to open and edit the `.xlsx` file to:

- Redact any information you do not want to share with AWS.
- Open the **Assets** tab in the spreadsheet to add tags to the **Environment**, **Application**, **Department**, and so on, columns.

In this example, the Device42 report is named **TSO Logic.xlsx**.

1. In the Migration Evaluator console, select **Discover > Self Reported Files**, and then click **Upload**.
2. Select your Device42 report file, and click **Upload**.

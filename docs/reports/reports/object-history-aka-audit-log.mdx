Every change made to Device42 Configuration Items (CIs), via the user interface, autodiscovery jobs, RESTful API calls, or imports, is recorded as history. 

This section discusses how to view and filter audit logs and exclude object categories (models) from being logged. 

## The Audit Log List Page

Go to **Analytics > Audit Logs > History** to view the audit history. Use the search bar on the right to find changes made by a specific user or source. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="History (audit log) list page"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/history-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/history-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Click the **gear icon** to customize the columns displayed in the table. By default, the following columns are included:

- **Type**: Indicates the category of the object that was changed (for example, Device, Global Settings, Application Group, Contract, and so on).
- **Object**: Displays the specific object that was changed. Click an object to filter the table by that object.
- **Changed**: Shows what was added and what was changed. For database objects, the database ID of the object is shown.
- **Action**: Displays the type of action that was logged (for example, Insert, Delete, Update, View, Login, API).
- **Origin**: Shows the source of the change (for example, UI, API, Task, and Internal). 

### Dropdown Filters

Apply filters to narrow down the results displayed in the table. Use the **Action Date/Time** dropdown to limit the results to a specific duration or date range. 

The **User**, **Type**, **Action**, and **Origin** dropdown menus are included in the UI by default. To add additional filters, click the **More Filters** button.

Use the **Advanced** button to query the audit logs by properties such as `object_id` and `action_id`. 

Click on the **gear icon** to save the filters you've applied for quick access later or to save the view as the default view.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/time-filter-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/time-filter-dark.png'),
  }}
/>


### Export as CSV

Select the columns you want to export, and use the **Export Selected Columns as CSV** action or the ellipsis icon to the right of each record to export the selected records in CSV format.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/action-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/action-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## View History for Individual Objects

In addition to this centralized audit log, you can access the history of an individual object from its view or edit pages. 

- For discovery job objects, use the **ellipsis icon** to access the history log for each object.
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Object history button"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/history-button-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/history-button-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

  The default view for history logs is **Direct Only**. To see the changes made to related data, such as the IPs of a device, change the filter option to **All** or **Related Only**.

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Object history filter"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/history-filter-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/history-filter-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- Objects like devices and IP addresses have the **Audit Logs** tab on their view pages and also include the **Related** dropdown filter option mentioned above.

    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/device-view-audit-logs-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/device-view-audit-logs-dark.png'),
    }}
  />


## Audit Log Exclusions

You can turn off history tracking for object categories. Navigate to **Tools > Settings > History (Audit Log) Exclusions** and click **Edit**. 

Select one or more object categories from the **Available Models** and use the arrow button to add them to the **Excluded Models** box.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/object-history-aka-audit-log/exclusions-dark.png'),
  }}

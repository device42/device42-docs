You can generate a Device42 AWS Migration Hub report from Device42's predefined reports and upload the report to the AWS Migration Hub portal. Follow the steps below.

- Select **Analytics > Advanced Reporting**, and from the left panel, go to **Pre-Defined Reports > Integrations > Workload Portability**.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/aws-migration-hub/aws-migration-location-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/aws-migration-hub/aws-migration-location-dark.png'),
    }}
    />  

- Select the **AWS Migration Hub** hamburger menu, choose **Export As**, and then click **CSV**. This generates and downloads a report — the amount of time required to generate the report depends on how much Device42 data you have.

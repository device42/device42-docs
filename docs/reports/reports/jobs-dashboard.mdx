## View Running Discovery Jobs on the Jobs Dashboard 

The Jobs Dashboard provides users with actionable insight into running discovery jobs. Whether you're running
network scans, hypervisor discovery, or cloud assessments, this dashboard gives you real-time visibility into job statuses, with the ability to 'kill' jobs and export job details as a CSV file.

Via the main menu, navigate to **Analytics > Jobs Dashboard**. The dashboard has three other sub-dashboards: **Completed Jobs**, **Queue Processing Stats**, and **Other Jobs Summary**.

  }}
/>

### Kill and Delete a Running or Hung Discovery Job

Check the box next to the job name(s) you want to kill, then select one of the **Kill selected job(s)** options from the dropdown menu:

* The first **Allow Pending Jobs to Complete** option will terminate the ongoing discovery but let any payloads in the queue finish processing. 
* The second **Remove Pending Jobs Immediately** option will terminate the ongoing discovery job and remove any payloads in the queue. If a discovery is half-finished when cancelled, it will be ended, and no further devices will be added or updated. However, if timed correctly, there may be an edge case where payloads are dispatched to the MA after emptying the queue.

## Sub-Dashboards

There are three other [sub-dashboards](#sub-dashboards) tabs on the Jobs Summary list page: **Completed Jobs**, **Queue Processing Stats**, and **Other Jobs Summary**.

### Completed Jobs

The Completed Jobs page lists jobs that have run in the past and are no longer running.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard/jobs-dashboard-completed-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

**Delete or Export From Completed Jobs** 

You can also delete a completed job from the Completed Jobs page or export one or more completed jobs to a CSV. Check the box next to the line(s) you are interested in and choose your desired action from the **Actions** dropdown menu. 

<ThemedImage

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard/jobs-dashboard-export-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Queue Processing Stats

The queue processing stats sub-dashboard allows you to monitor the status of various queues within Device42. 

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard/jobs-dashboard-queue-processing-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/jobs-dashboard/jobs-dashboard-queue-processing-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Other Jobs Summary

Jobs that don't utilize the main Jobs Dashboard will be found in the **Other Jobs Summary** sub-dashboard. Other jobs include RU (Resource Utilization) jobs, SP (Service Port) jobs, vserver jobs and others. Job statuses can be monitored and you can also kill any running job from this page by selecting the checkbox next to it and choosing **Kill Selected Jobs** as your action.

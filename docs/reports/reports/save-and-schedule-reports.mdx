All scheduling definitions are recurring. If you select specific weekdays, the report will run every week on those weekdays at the time specified.

If you select specific weeks, then the report will run every month in the specified week(s) on the specified day(s) at the specified time. For example, if you select week1 and Tuesday, it will send you a report every first Tuesday of the month at the specified time.

Also, please go to Tools > Settings > Time Settings to verify that your time settings are correct. If you need to change the time settings (other than the time zone), you will need to do this from your vm console menu options.

### Adding report name and email addresses

Add a unique name for the report to save it. You can add multiple email addresses separated by comma.

Once you click Save & Schedule, it will save the report and schedule it. Each time it runs, it will send a copy of the report to all specified email addressees.

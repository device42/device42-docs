Advanced Reporting in Device42, added mid-2018, empowers you to create and schedule extremely complex reports that the old reporting engine simply couldn't handle. You can also combine all of the built-in reports and features that advanced reporting includes out-of-the-box with your own custom SQL objects to achieve an entirely new level of reporting flexibility, including using SQL's ability to pre-process and transform objects as part of your query.

## Create an Advanced Report Using Custom SQL

1. Head to **Analytics > Reports > Advanced Reporting**.
2. Add a new Advanced Report and give it a name.
3. Don’t select any categories; instead, choose the **Add SQL** button at the bottom right.
4. Give your new SQL object a name, and then proceed to enter your query into the **Custom SQL Object** form. Select a unique key field from the dropdown at the bottom of the window (a unique key is required). Click **Okay** twice:

_*You’ll notice all of the categories are now greyed out. The SQL query you provided has taken care of this, so there’s no need to choose any here._

1. Head to the **Layout** tab. Use the report designer to format your report data by choosing placing the fields you’d like to include into the report.
2. Click **Finish** to save.
3. You’re done! You can go back and edit as you see fit. Run your report at at any time, or sort and filter it further.

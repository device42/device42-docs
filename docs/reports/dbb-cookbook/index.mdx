**Introduction**

The Data Building Blocks Cookbook is a collection of insightful queries that provide report examples for common use cases. These "recipes" often feature the new DBBs. These queries can be used "as is" or modified to meet business reporting requirements. We will continue to expand the Cookbook as required and as new DBBs are added.

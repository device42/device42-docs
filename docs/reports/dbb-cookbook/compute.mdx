Data Building Blocks are materialized database views composed with customer-specific use cases in mind to allow users to quickly create reports with little-to-no extra view joining required. These views are refreshed on a nightly basis. Because of the requirements for this type of reporting, it is necessary for the user to have access to all the Device42 data. A special privilege has been created called _Data Building Blocks_ for this purpose and must be granted for a user to have access to the DBB views. The reason for this is to simplify the access to data for reporting and insight needs.

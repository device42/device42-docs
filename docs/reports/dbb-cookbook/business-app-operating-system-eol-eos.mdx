This query also utilizes the Compute DBB to gather information on all BusinessApp Impacting Devices that are using an OS that is going to hit EOL/EOS within the next 90 days.

Use this if you need to analyze many of the changes needed when that EOL/EOS date approaches.

You can easily shift the window or focus on either EOL/EOS by editing the included `WHERE` filter clause.

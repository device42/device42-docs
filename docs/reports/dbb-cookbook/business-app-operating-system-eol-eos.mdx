Business App Operating System EOL / EOS Impact

```sql
/*
* BusinessApp OS EOL/EOS Impacts
* This query also utilizes the Compute DBB to gather information on all BusinessApp Impacting Devices that are using an OS that is going to hit EOL/EOS within the next 90 days.
* Use this if you need to analyze mny of the changes needed when that EOL/EOS date approaches.
* You can easily shift the window or focus on either EOL/EOS by editing the included WHERE filter clause.

InsightsAI generates queries from the natural language descriptions you provide to quickly generate DOQL queries and tailored reports from your CMDB. 

By typing plain English messages, like “Which SSL/TLS certificates are expiring in the next 90 days?” or "Find all Resources where name contains 'Nested,'" InsightsAI will create the query that can be executed without requiring deep knowledge of the query language or data model. You can preview the results and refine the query as needed.

## Create a New Chat

Navigate to **Analytics > Ask InsightsAI** from the Device42 Main Appliance to create a new chat. 

<ThemedImage

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/1-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '70%' }} 
/>

From the Ask InsightsAI page, type in a description of the data you want to fetch in the text box.

![InsightsAI page](/assets/images/insightsai/ui-insights-page.png)

The two buttons above the input box gets you started with an initial query that you can refine by submitting follow-up messages. Click **Device report** to start a new chart with the input:

```
Get me a query with the name, serial number, and hardware name for the first 20 devices.
```

Clicking the **Recently discovered resources** button starts a chat with:

```
Get me a query for 50 resources discovered in the past week ordered by resource type.
```

Click the **+ New Chat** button to create a new chat in a new browser tab. 

Go to the InsightsAI Chats list page by clicking the **Past Chats** button.

## Query Result Options

InsightsAI generates an SQL query with the table and parameters in response to your input. See [Database Viewer Schema](db-viewer-schema.md) for information on locating database field names and descriptions.

The input for this example is:

```
find all devices in production
```

<ThemedImage
  alt="DOQL AI example response"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/3-enter-query-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/3-enter-query-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Refine the Responses

If the data or query needs to be refined, ask a follow-up question, InsightsAI will provide a new response.  

For example, the previous results did not include information on device types. You can give InsightsAI another direction to include the type of device and only find virtual devices.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Follow-up response"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/refine-response-device-type-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/refine-response-device-type-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Although the InsightsAI brain knows the data model well, it continues to learn and train on the input and will provide increasingly accurate responses and need fewer refinement questions over time. InsightsAI only has access to the default database schema, not your data. 

### Copy the SQL Response

From the InsightsAI response, select the **Copy** option to copy the SQL query to your clipboard. You can paste the SQL code into a new tab of an existing report to build a report.

### Preview Query Results

Click **Preview** to run the query and quickly view the returned data in a modal window. This result is displayed but not saved.

You can search for specific items using the **Search** bar, search individual column data, and print the query results from the preview window:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Results preview"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/4-preview-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/4-preview-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Create a Report Page

To save the generated query, click **Report** on the InsightsAI [response toolbar](#query-result-options) to go to the report setup page and provide a **Report Name**.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Report page options"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/5-report-options-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/5-report-options-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- **(1) Save and Display On Screen:**  View, search, and print the data records.
  
    <ThemedImage
    alt="Report example"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/6-view-report-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/insightsai/6-view-report-dark.png'),
    }}
    />    

- **(2) Export:** Download a `.tsv` or `.xls` file of the query result. 
- **(3) Report Schedule:** Periodically run the query and email the results by filling in the fields.

## InsightsAI Chats List Page

Click the **Past Chats** button on the [InsightsAI](#create-a-new-chat) page or the [chat response](#query-result-options) page to navigate to the list page. The InsightsAI Chats List Page contains a record of your past chats that are automatically saved.

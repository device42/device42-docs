DOQL queries are run against the Device42 database via both HTTPS and the RESTful API. You can make requests using curl, or alternatively, by pointing your favorite REST API client at the DOQL query endpoints below. Consulting the DOQL query parameters and example queries that follow can be helpful as well.

:::tip
Use our [InsightsAI chat](insightsai.mdx), under **Analytics > InsightsAI** on the MA, to create and interpret DOQL query snippets quickly in the context of the Device42 data tables.

### DOQL Query API Endpoint Example

Visit the [Device42 API documentation](https://api.device42.com/) for more information on DOQL query endpoints.

**DOQL Endpoint**: `/services/data/v1.0/query/`

**Example**:
```bash
https://localhost/services/data/v1.0/query/?query=SELECT name, os_name, os_version FROM view_device_v1 order by device_pk
```

**Curl example:** 
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -d "query=select name from view_appcomp_v1 where lower(name) like 'microsoft sql%' or lower(name) like 'postgresql%' or lower(name) like 'mongodb%' or lower(name) like 'mysql%' or lower(name) like 'oracle database%' or lower(name) like 'sap%' or lower(name) like 'sybase%' or lower(name) like 'mariadb%'" \
  -u $(cat apipw) \
  'https://yourdevice42/services/data/v1.0/query/'
```

### Query Results in JSON Format

If you'd like your DOQL query results in JSON format, set the `output_type` query parameter to `json`. For example:

```bash
curl -k -s -X POST \
  -d 'output_type=json&query=select * from view_device_v1' \
  -u 'admin:adm!nd42' \
  'http://server/services/data/v1.0/query/'
```

### DOQL API Query Parameters

The following database query parameters can be used with DOQL via the API. The required parameters are `query` and `output_type`.

- **`query`**: This is the DOQL query you want to run, a `SELECT` command that returns results as CSV data (required).
- **`delimiter`**: This specifies the character that separates columns within each row (line) of the file. The default is a comma (`,`). This must be a single one-byte character.
- **`header`**: If `yes`, this specifies that the file contains a header line with the names of each column in the file. On output, the first line contains the column names from the table.
- **`quote`**: This specifies the quoting character to be used when a data value is quoted. The default is a double-quote (`"`). It must be a single one-byte character.
- **`null_string`**: A parameter defining how null values are represented in the CSV. The default is an empty string, but you can customize this (for example, to represent nulls with a specific string like `'NULL'`).
- **`quote_escape`**: This specifies the character that should appear before a data character that matches the `QUOTE` value. The default is the same as the `QUOTE` value (so that the quoting character is doubled if it appears in the data). It must be a single one-byte character.
- **`output_type`**: Get JSON results by setting this parameter to `json`.

### The Data Dictionary, ERD, and Viewer Schema

The Data Dictionary is available in JSON format via the API at the following endpoint:

```
/services/data/v1.0/dd/
```

See the [Database Viewer Schema page](db-viewer-schema.mdx) for information on the DB viewer schema and Entity Relationship Diagram, both of which are very handy when authoring queries, providing valuable insight into the Device42 database schema.

## DOQL Queries Against Custom Fields

When constructing DOQL queries against custom fields, keep in mind that custom field names are usually case-sensitive. Custom field names with only lowercase characters and no spaces can be referenced (as the column name in the database) with any casing in queries. Custom field names with **uppercase characters** or **spaces** must be referenced using the exact casing in double quotes.

**For example, consider the following telco custom field names**:

- For `Region`, the appropriate query would be: 
```sql
select "Region" from view_telcocircuit_custom_fields_flat_v1
```

- For `region name`, the query would need to be:
```sql
select "region name" from view_telcocircuit_custom_fields_flat_v1
```

- For `region`, since it only has lowercase characters and no spaces, the query is:
```sql
select region from view_telcocircuit_custom_fields_flat_v1
```

## Saved DOQL Queries

With **Saved DOQL Queries**, you can centrally store, track, and re-use queries written for prior integrations, automation projects, or other efforts. It is easy to add and customize these queries. You can reference the name of a saved query (for example, "Prod_Switches") to call it from any integration. Saved queries are also leveraged by Device42 integrations as 'system-defined' queries.

To add, edit, and view your stored DOQL queries, go to **Tools > Integrations > Saved DOQL Queries** from the main menu.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Saved DOQL Queries menu item"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/saved-doql-queries-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/saved-doql-queries-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Add a New Saved DOQL Query

- Click **+ Add Saved DOQL Query** to add a new query from the **DOQL Query View** list page.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Saved DOQL Queries menu item"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/saved-queries-list-page-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/saved-queries-list-page-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Enter the query name, the DOQL query itself, and any notes you'd like to add. Use the **Test SQL** button to check the validity of the query before saving.
 
    <ThemedImage
    alt="DOQL Query form"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/save-query-fields-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/save-query-fields-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

### DOQL Query URL

Each saved DOQL query has an associated **Query URL**, which can be seen next to each query on the **Saved DOQL Queries** list page and at the bottom of an individual query's details page.

<ThemedImage
  alt="View saved DOQL Query"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/view-saved-query-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/view-saved-query-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The query URL links to the DOQL query API endpoint and returns the results of that specific DOQL query in CSV format. For more information on running DOQL queries via the Device42 API, see the [DOQL Query API Endpoint Example](#doql-query-api-endpoint-example) and [DOQL API Query Parameters](##doql-api-query-parameters) sections of this page.

### Edit or Clone an Existing Saved DOQL Query

- To edit an existing DOQL query, click the name of the query you'd like to edit, and from the **View Saved DOQL Query** screen, click **Edit** in the upper-right corner. You can also **Clone DOQL Query** to create a new query based on the existing one.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Edit button for saved DOQL Query"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/edit-button-saved-query-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/edit-button-saved-query-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- You can now make any necessary edits to the DOQL query you were looking at, and can even add notes. Click the **Save** button when you are done editing your DOQL Query.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Edit saved DOQL Query"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/edit-query-fields-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device42-doql/edit-query-fields-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

## Device42 DOQL Notes

- Wherever possible, DOQL syntax is equivalent to PostgreSQL syntax, but this document highlights the areas where the two syntaxes differ.
- `POST` calls are recommended rather than `GET` calls, as the URL length isn't limited in `POST` calls.
- If using `GET` calls, note that URL length is limited, and any special characters in the query need to be URL-encoded (for example, `%20` for `space` and `%3B` for `%`).

## Obtaining DOQL Support

Generate DOQL queries by entering natural language descriptions in the **InsightsAI** chat, under **Analytics > InsightsAI** on the MA. See the [InsightsAI page](insightsai.mdx) for more details.

You can also refer to the Entity Relationship Diagram and Data Dictionary table to get the names of Device42 database tables and columns (fields) and lookup relationships. See the [Database Viewer Schema page](db-viewer-schema.mdx) for more details.

Please note that Device42 does not assist users with writing DOQL queries. However, if you encounter a bug, please report it to our support team at [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com) and we will fix it as part of our normal bug-fixing process.

The database viewer schema tools are a resource for consulting on the structure of the Device42 database. 

This page walks you through accessing and using the two database viewer tools, the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and the Data Dictionary.

## Locate the Viewer Tools

The database viewer tools are found under the help menu. Hover your cursor over the **question mark icon** to reveal the **Viewer Schema** options: **Entity Relationship Diagram** and **Data Dictionary**.

  }}
/>

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The ERD is a handy way to navigate the Device42 database schema, visualize relationships, and use the information to assemble DOQL queries. 

- The ERD is searchable using the **Find** field, below the **Device42 - Viewer Entity Relationship Diagram** header. By searching for `device`, database views that contain "device" are highlighted (for example, `view_device_v2` and other related fields), while others fade into the background:

    <ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/edr-device-example-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/edr-device-example-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- Click the **tiny triangle symbol** on a table to expand it or use the **Expand All** button to expand all the database entities:

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/tiny-triangle-closed-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/tiny-triangle-closed-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Expanded entity"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/tiny-triangle-open-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/tiny-triangle-open-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

## Data Dictionary

The Data Dictionary is a text-based viewer used to explore the details of the Device42 database. Each view lists the **Column** names in the database table, the **Data Type** for those columns, and a short **Description** of each of those fields.

You can filter by Data Building Blocks (**DBB**), Device42 Object Query Language (**DOQL**), or both (**All**) views.

- **DBB**: Structured database views require little to no extra view-joining, and are composed to let you quickly create reports. These views are refreshed on a nightly basis. 

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Data Dictionary DBB view"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/data-dictionary-dbb-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/data-dictionary-dbb-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

- **DOQL**: These raw, less-structured views provide full access to all the information discovered and stored in Device42. Use them to create custom queries and reports for any use case, whether building queries from scratch or just adding one or two more fields to a DBB-based report.

        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/data-dictionary-doql-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/db-viewer-schema/data-dictionary-doql-dark.png'),
    }}
    />

### Data Dictionary API

If you prefer using our API, you can also get the Data Dictionary from this endpoint: 

```
/services/data/v1.0/dd/
```
Find the parameter explanations and more details about running DOQL queries via the API on the [DOQL - Device42 Object Query Language page](index.mdx).

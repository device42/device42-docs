DOQL AI generates queries from the natural language descriptions you provide, streamlining the process of getting information and detailed reports from your Device42 CMDB.

Navigate to **Analytics > Ask DOQL AI** from the Device42 Main Appliance to create a new chat.

## Create a New Chat

From the Ask DOQL AI page, type in a description of the data you want to fetch in the text box.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/doql-ai/2-chat-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The two buttons above the input box gets you started with an initial query that you can refine by submitting follow-up messages. Click **Device report** to start a new chart with the input:

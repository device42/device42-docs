This article will guide you through getting started with Device42 using existing data in .xls format. This includes any data you already have in a spreadsheet, and data that you exported from other systems like Rackmonkey. If the data exists in a spreadsheet, or if you have a way of getting your data into a spreadsheet, then the Device42 import feature makes it easy for you to import.

Note that the **import** and **auto discovery** features are complementary, not alternatives. That is, you can still enable auto discovery before or after importing data from a spreadsheet. Device42 will correlate the data appropriately.

## Importing XLS (spreadsheet) files

Navigate to **Tools > Imports/Exports(xls)**. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Select import/export menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-data-from-existing-spreadsheets/import-01-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/importing-data-from-existing-spreadsheets/import-01-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

On this page you will find sample spreadsheets and links to detailed documentation.

The Device42 Windows Service Wrapper is an executable (available separately for i386 32-bit and 64-bit architectures) that can be installed as a service. Download the Windows Service Wrapper from [the Device42 Autodiscovery page](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/). The service wrapper calls the Device42 Windows agent, which you can download from your Device42 Main Appliance (MA).

## Installation Overview

You will need three separate files to install the service.

1. **The service executable itself**: This is named `d42_winservice_P_V.exe`. Its default path is `C:\Program Files\Device42`.
2. **The d42config.json file**: This dictates the various settings needed to run the service. Its default path is `C:\ProgramData\Device42`.
3. **The agent executable**: This is called `d42_winagent_x(bit).exe`. It can be downloaded from the Device42 MA under **Discovery > Agent Based Scans (Win7+)**.

There are multiple ways to install and start the service. For your convenience, we have added a PowerShell script (option 1). Below that we include detailed steps for installing with `sc` if needed (option 2).

### Option 1: Using the PowerShell Script

- Download the combined zip file and extract it to your local file system.
- Ensure that PowerShell remote execution is enabled (`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`).
- Drop the agent executable, downloaded from the Device42 MA, into the same folder.
- **Optional:** Modify the example `d42config.json` file. For example, you could change the interval or add arguments (as documented below).
- Run the PowerShell script:

  ```
  .\D42Installer.ps1
  ```

  This script drops different files based on the machine architecture.

- **Optional:** Revert the execution policy.

### Option 2: Using `sc` Commands

- By default, the service wrapper looks for an agent named `d42winagent.exe` under `C:\Program Files\Device42` on the end machine. Check that you've saved the agent using the correct name and location.

- The service calls the agent on service start and then again every `8` hours. You can override these values in the `d42config.json` file.

  For example:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
  ```js
  {
    "executablePath": "c:\\Program Files\\Device42\\d42_winagent.exe",
    "WorkingDir": "c:\\ProgramData\\Device42",
    "arguments": ["-host=https://10.92.11.63","-skip-software=true"],
    "interval": 2
  }
  ```
</details>

:::note
Each of the `"arguments"` is enclosed in double quotes.

The `"interval"` can be anything from `1` to `24` hours.
:::

- Use `sc create` to create the service.

  ```shell
  sc create d42AgentService binPath= "C:\Program Files\\Device42\d42_winservice_386.exe" start= auto (or d42_winservice_x64.exe)
  ```

:::note
Notice the space after the `=` sign in the above command. It is critical.
:::

- You can use `sc start` to start the service, or start it from the UI.

  ```shell
  sc start d42AgentService
  ```

- You can use the `sc description` command to provide a friendly description of the service.

  ```shell
  sc description d42AgentService "D42 service that calls the agent to run every N hours to send inventory details to Device42"
  ```

- To query or stop the service, use the following (optional) commands:

  ```shell
  sc query d42AgentService
  ```

  ```shell
  sc stop d42AgentService
  ```

:::note
On Windows, `sc create` and `sc start`  read from `%windir%/system32` by default.

If you don't have `C:` or don't want to use `C:\ProgramData\Device42`, you can place `d42config.json` in the `system32` directory.
:::

### Arguments for the Config Files

As shown in the example above, each argument should be enclosed in double quotes and separated by a comma.

### Log Output

The `agent_local.log` file will be created under the current working directory.

### Handling Errors

![Windows service wrapper error](/assets/images/windows-service-wrapper-error.png)

If the service doesn’t start, it's usually because it can’t read the `d42config.json` file.

The file should be located under `$ProgramData\Device42` or `%windir%\system32` (`sc` reads from the system folder by default, so for any non-standard location, this is where the file needs to be).

Another issue might be that the format or the values are incorrect.

The Device42 Windows Service Wrapper is an executable (available separately for i386 32-bit and 64-bit architectures) that can be installed as a service. Download the Windows Service Wrapper from the [autodiscovery page of the Device42 website](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/). The service wrapper calls the Device42 Windows agent that you can download from your Device42 main appliance. 

## Overview of installation

At a high level, there are three separate files that you need to install the service. 

1. **The service executable itself**: This is named `d42_winservice_P_V.exe`. Its default path is `C:\Program Files\Device42`. 
2. **The d42config.json file**: This dictates the various settings needed to run the service. Its default path is `C:\ProgramData\Device42`.
3. **The agent executable**: This is called `d42_winagent_x(bit).exe` and can be downloaded from the Device42 main appliance under **Discovery > Agent Based Scans (Win7+)**.

There are multiple ways you can install and start the service. For your convenience, we have added a PowerShell script (option 1). Below that we include detailed steps for installing with `sc` if needed (option 2).

### Option 1 - PowerShell script:

- Download the combined zip file and extract it to your local file system.
- Make sure PowerShell remote execution is enabled (`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`).
- Drop the agent executable downloaded from the Device42 main appliance into the same folder.
- **Optional:** Modify the example `d42config.json` file. For example, you can change the interval or add arguments as documented below)
- Run the PowerShell script (this script drops different files based on the machine architecture):
`.\D42Installer.ps1`
- **Optional:** Revert the execution policy.

### Option 2 - Use `sc`

By default the service wrapper looks for the agent named `d42winagent.exe` under `C:\Program Files\Device42` on the end machine and calls it on service start, and then every eight hours. 

You can override these values in the `d42config.json` file (example provided below).

You can use `sc create` to create the service, and then start it using `sc start` or from the UI.

The `sc description` command can be used to give a friendly description to it.

```
# On a Windows machine: drop the agent under Program Files\\Device42 as d42winagent.exe
# (make sure that the agent is named that unless you are using d42config.json file to override that)

# For the command below, notice the space after the = sign below. It is critical.
sc create d42AgentService binPath= "C:\Program Files\\Device42\d42_winservice_386.exe" start= auto (or d42_winservice_x64.exe)
sc description d42AgentService "D42 service that calls the agent to run every N hours to send inventory details to Device42"
sc start d42AgentService  # You can also start from the UI

# To query or stop, use (optional)
# sc query d42AgentService
# sc stop d42AgentService

# Note: sc create/start on Windows reads from %windir%/system32 by default. 
# If the user doesn't have C: or doesn't want to use C:\ProgramData\Device42, they can place d42config.json in the system32 directory.

# Example d42config.json file below. Note that each arg is enclosed in double-quotes.
# Interval could be from 1 hour to 24*7 hours
# {
#   "executablePath": "c:\\Program Files\\Device42\\d42_winagent.exe",
#   "WorkingDir": "c:\\ProgramData\\Device42",
#   "arguments": ["-host=https://10.92.11.63","-skip-software=true"],
#   "interval": 2
# }

```

### Arguments for the config files:

As shown in the example above, each argument should be enclosed in double quotes and separated by a comma. 

### Log output:

The `agent_local.log` file will be created under the current working directory.

### Handling errors

![Windows service wrapper error](/assets/images/windows-service-wrapper-error.png)

If the service doesn’t start, it is generally because it can’t read the `d42config.json` file. 

It should either live under `c:\opt\device42`, or `%windir%\system32` (`sc` reads from the system folder by default, so for any non-standard location, this is where the file needs to be).

Another issue might be that the format or the values are incorrect.

Use the sizing recommendations below to properly provision your Device42 Main Appliance, Remote Collectors, and Windows Discovery Service. 

The sizing requirements depend on the size of the environment and the Device42 features used.

| Device42 Item                                    | Sizing and Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| One Main Appliance (virtual appliance) | **Small to medium environments (\<2500 devices):**  <br/> - Four vCPU <br/> - 16GB RAM <br/> - 150GB vDisk (SSD or flash disk recommended)<br/><br/>  **Medium to large environments (>2500 devices):** <br/>- 16 vCPU <br/>- 64GB RAM <br/>- 150GB vDisk (SSD or flash disk recommended)<br/><br/>  For any environments that include Application Dependency Mapping (ADM), Resource Utilization (RU), or Storage discovery, follow the medium to large environment guidelines |
| Remote Collector(s) (virtual appliance) | **One RC per 1000 workloads:** <br/>- Two vCPU <br/>- 4GB RAM <br/>- 50GB vDisk |
| Windows Discovery Service (.NET installer) | **One WDS per 1000 workloads:**  <br/> - Two vCPU <br/> - 8GB RAM <br/> - 50GB vDisk (minimum) |

Depending on your environment, we may recommend a dedicated resource pool for the virtual appliance to ensure there is no resource contention. 

Device42 utilizes a database within the virtual appliance we recommend solid-state storage, or similar storage optimized for database operations.

For Windows infrastructure, Device42 requires a WDS to be installed on one machine per discovery
segment/Remote Collector.

The Main Appliance (MA), Remote Collectors (RCs), and Windows Discovery Service (WDS) all play a role in discovering your IT environment. 

Device42 is deployed in a hub-and-spoke architecture; each RC/WDS collects data and syncs it back to the centralized MA. It is typically recommended for RCs and WDS instances to be deployed in pairs, if Windows discovery is required.

Device42 consists of the Main Appliance, one or more Remote Collectors (RCs), and a Windows Discovery Service (WDS). The Main Appliance is an interface for configuring and running discovery jobs, viewing and managing discovered Configuration Items (CIs), generating reports, and managing any third-party integrations.

The image below depicts a Production environment consisting of one Main Appliance and two sets
of Remote Collectors and Windows Discovery Service instances.

It is critical that network settings are correctly configured and firewall rules properly enabled
to grant appropriate access permissions while adhering to the principle of least privilege.
Once configured, we strongly recommend you perform connectivity tests to confirm these
changes were successfully made.

A reference list of all ports used to gain access to targets to be discovered can be found [here](/getstarted/installation/discovery-port-configurations/). It is **critical to provide this link to network personnel** so they can ensure the necessary ports are open so Device42 can discover your infrastructure.

### Where do I put this stuff?

:::caution
Device42 is delivered as a virtual appliance. Root access to the appliance is not supported, and the VM will cease to function if you attempt to break into the root account.
:::

Manage the Main Appliance using the [Appliance Manager (AM)](/administration/appliance-manager/index.mdx), from which you can restart and stop the Device42 application, generate logs or SNMP walks for tech support, and more.

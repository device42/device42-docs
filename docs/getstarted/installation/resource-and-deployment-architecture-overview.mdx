Learn about the Device42 core resources and how they fit into our deployment architecture.

## Device42 Resources

### Main Appliance

The Device42 Main Appliance (MA) is the kick-off point for all the discovery and insights that will proliferate through your environment. It is a preconfigured virtual appliance (built on Linux) hosted by the end customer, enabling full protection under the client’s data center security architecture and policies.

Device42 operates with only five ports open to the virtual appliance:

- **Port 80:** Redirects to port 443
- **Port 443:** Web (HTTPS)
- **Port 4242:** Redirects to port 4343
- **Port 4343:** Appliance manager (HTTPS)
- **Port 404:** SSH for limited console menu operations

### Remote Collector

The Remote Collector (RC) is a much lighter preconfigured virtual appliance (built on Linux) used to perform agentless discovery across network segments. It also provides scalability by offloading discovery workloads from the MA. We require you to install at least one RC with any deployment of Device42.

### Windows Discovery Service

The Windows Discovery Service (WDS) is a `.net` service that runs on a Windows system and makes WMI queries on behalf of the Linux-based RC and MA. If you’ll be running Windows discoveries, you will need to deploy at least one WDS instance and connect it to an RC.

## Deployment Architecture

Device42 deployment architecture is similar to a hub-and-spoke model, with each RC/WDS collecting data and syncing back to the centralized MA. It is typically recommended that RCs and WDS instances are deployed in pairs if Windows discovery is required.

The Windows Discovery Service (WDS) should be connected directly to a Remote Collector (RC) to enable WMI discovery directly from the Device42 UI.

The .NET service must be installed on a Windows machine with the .NET runtimes installed.

## Installing the Windows Discovery Service

1. Download the current WDS `.msi` installer file from the [Device42 **Autodiscovery** software download page](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/).

2. Run the downloaded `Device42Discovery.msi` installer. Click **Next** and follow the prompts to continue with the installation:

3. In the **Device42 RC Link Setup** dialog, indicate your **RC Endpoint** by entering the RC IP address or FQDN in the first field.

4. Enter a one-time pin in the **RC Code** field, after generating it as follows:

    - From the Device42 MA, navigate to **Discovery > Remote Collectors**.

    <ThemedImage
      alt="Remote Collectors menu location"
      sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-discovery-service-installation/remote-collectors-menu-19.06-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-discovery-service-installation/remote-collectors-menu-19.06-dark.png'),
      }}
    />

    - Click **Generate OTP** in the upper-right corner of the **Remote Collectors** list page.

    <ThemedImage
      alt="Generate OTP"
      sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-discovery-service-installation/generate-otp-19.06-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-discovery-service-installation/generate-otp-19.06-dark.png'),
      }}
    />

5. Accept the default installation directory for the WDS service or specify a custom installation path.

![Select installation folder](/assets/images/select_install_folder.png)

6. Click **Next** to confirm installation.

7. Confirm that the installation was successful by checking that RCs in the Device42 UI have been renamed and the WDS indicator icon has turned green to reflect the WDS connection.

  }}
/>

### Securing WDS Implementation in Device42

Both the MA and the RC ship with a self-signed certificate, making it necessary to support invalid certificates with the default installation of Device42.

Install a valid certificate on the MA and the RC. You can then change the default behavior of the WDS to no longer ignore SSL errors by editing the WDS runtime configuration file:

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the code block</summary>
  ```markup
  <configuration>
    <appSettings>
  ....
      <add key="IgnoreSSLErrors" value="false"/>
  ....
    </appSettings>
  ...  
  ```
</details>

## Create a New WMI Autodiscovery Job

You are now ready to run discoveries with your new WDS. When creating a new Windows WMI autodiscovery job (**Discovery > Hypervisors/\*nix/win for Autodiscovery**), choose the WDS connected to the RC with WDS, and configure the job settings to discover Windows devices:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add new Windows Discovery Job"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-discovery-service-installation/wds-example-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/windows-discovery-service-installation/wds-example-19.06-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

:::caution
Do not set up an autodiscovery scan using critical production account credentials! Please create a separate, dedicated account to use only for discovery.

Depending on your permissions and configured password policies, account lockout could result in an otherwise avoidable outage. You as a customer are responsible for any such behavior.

## Update Your WDS Installation

You do not need to update your WDS installation separately. After the initial connection, WDS updates are automatically pushed and distributed with regular Device42 updates.

If you are concerned that you are not running the latest version of WDS, please [update your main Device42 appliance](how-to-videos/update-device42-appliance-how-to.mdx) to the latest version.

This guide will walk you through installing the Device42 Main Appliance on VMware vCenter Server. The installation process involves deploying an OVF template, configuring network settings, and accessing the web interface.

## Outline of Installation Steps

1. Download and unzip the compressed Device42 virtual appliance.
2. From the vCenter Server interface, select the unzipped `.ovf` file. 
3. Follow the VMware prompts and choose your location, datastore, and NIC.
4. Power on the newly deployed Device42 virtual appliance. 
5. Log in to the Device42 console using the default credentials and update the credentials.
6. Configure the static IP address from the console.
7. Log in to the Device42 web interface from a browser: `https://FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP-address`. Update the login credentials here as well.

## Illustrated Steps of Installing Device42 on vCenter Server

Set up your Device42 instance by following these steps.

### Log In to the Device42 Console

From the vCenter Server interface, open the VM console for your Device42 appliance. The Device42 console login screen will appear automatically.

Log in using the default credentials and change them after logging in:

   - **Username:** `device42`
   - **Password:** `adm!nd42` 

### Configure the Static IP Address

From the console, configure the IP address. Use a **static IP** for all production Device42 VMs to avoid connectivity issues.

### Create a DNS Entry

This is an optional step: Create a DNS entry for the new IP address of the virtual appliance.

### Log In to the Web Interface

Point your browser to `https://FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP-address`.

Log in to the **web interface** using the default credentials:

    - **Username:** `admin`
    - **Password:** `adm!nd42` 
    
    Please change the username and password as soon as you log in.

## Using SSH

You can apply Device42 updates, as well as do other menu-related work using **SSH** via **port 404**. Please note that root login has been disabled.

## Next Steps

Install the Device42 [Remote Collector](remote-collector-rc-installation.mdx) and [Windows Discovery Service](windows-discovery-service-installation.mdx) before creating your first discovery job. 

You can import data into Device42 using the [Device42 API](https://api.device42.com/) or the [**Import/Export (xls)**](/getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets.mdx) tool.

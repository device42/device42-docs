Install the Device42 Main Appliance on Xen- or KVM-based platforms by following the steps in this guide.

## Download the Image and Uncompress 

The raw image for Xen or KVM has been compressed using bzip2. When you get the file on the KVM host, run the `bunzip2` command to uncompress the file:

```bash
bunzip2 device42-3.2.3-raw.img.bz2
```

## Create the Virtual Machine

Create a new virtual machine with the **Import existing disk image** setting.  

If you don't see the option to **Import existing disk Image**, please visit the link and follow the instructions: [How do I Install device42 Xen or KVM appliance if import existing disk image option is missing?](https://support.device42.com/hc/en-usentries/22412668)

![Install](/assets/images/wpid6123-Download_and_Install.png)

Choose **Linux** as the **OS type** and **Ubuntu 14.04** for the **Version**. If you don't see the option for **14.04**, choose the latest version available.

![Choosing OS and version](/assets/images/wpid6121-Choosing_OS_and_version.png)

Allocate at least `8` GB RAM and `2` vCPU for production appliances. See [Sizing Recommendations](sizing-recommendations.mdx).

Install the Device42 Main Appliance on Xen or KVM-based platforms by following the steps in this guide.

## Download the Image and Uncompress 

The raw image for Xen or KVM has been compressed using bzip2. When you get the file on the KVM host, run the `bunzip2` command to uncompress the file:

```bash
bunzip2 device42-3.2.3-raw.img.bz2
```

## Create the Virtual Machine

1. Create a new virtual machine with the setting "Import existing disk image".  

    If you don't see the option to "Import existing disk Image", please visit the link and follow the instructions: [How do I Install device42 Xen or KVM appliance if import existing disk image option is missing?](https://support.device42.com/hc/en-usentries/22412668)

2. Choose "Linux" as the **OS type** and "Ubuntu 14.04" for the **version**. If you don't see the option for 14.04, choose the latest version available.

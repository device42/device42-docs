:::info
These are **special case** installation instructions for installing the Device42 appliance on Xen- or KVM-based platforms if the **Import existing disk image** option is missing. Otherwise, please refer to the Device42 [guide to Xen and KVM installation](getstarted/installation/installation-xen-or-kvm-using-virt-manager.mdx).
:::

### Download and Uncompress With bunzip2

The raw image for Xen or KVM has been compressed using bzip2. When you get the file on the KVM host, run the `bunzip2` command to uncompress the file:

```bash
bunzip2 device42-3.2.3-raw.img.bz2
```

### Create a New Virtual Machine

Once you have uncompressed the downloaded raw image, create a new virtual machine. 

Choose the **Network Boot** option. We'll add the disk later. Please make sure you don't have any kind of automated network boot enabled for this machine. You will not see the **Import existing disk image** option.

### Choose OS and Version

Choose **Linux** as the **OS type** and **Ubuntu 14.04** for the **Version**. If you don't see the option for **14.04**, choose the latest version available.

Allocate at least `8` GB RAM and `2` vCPU for production appliances. See the Device42 [Sizing Recommendations](sizing-recommendations.mdx) page for more information.

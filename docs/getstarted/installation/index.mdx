title: "Deploy Device42"
---

The Deploy phase contains a series of tasks, and each of these tasks requires steps to complete.

## About the Deploy Tasks

For each task you may find one or more of the following:
-  A simplified list of steps to enable you to **understand** the steps, but may in some
cases lack all the detail to complete the tasks.
- A link to a web page that includes all the detail you will need to **perform** the task, including options you may or may not choose to enable.
- A link to a video to **see** the task performed, along with related commentary.

## Device42 Components

In the Deploy phase you will install and configure:
- The **Device42 Main Appliance (MA)**
- **Remote Collectors (RCs)** 
- **Windows Discovery Service (WDS) instances**
- (optionally) **Device42 Discovery Agents**

Prior to performing these tasks you must understand each of these components, their prerequisites,
and how they interoperate.

### Component Descriptions

**Main Appliance:** The Device42 Main Appliance (MA) is a self-contained and self-maintaining
virtual appliance that serves as the core component of the Device42 system. It is a
pre-configured virtual appliance (built on Linux) that your organization hosts, enabling full
protection under your data center security architecture and policies.

**Remote Collector:** The Remote Collector (RC), is a lighter pre-configured virtual appliance (built
on Linux), used to perform agentless discovery across network segments. It also provides
scalability by offloading discovery workloads from the MA. The RC will connect to your
non-Windows targets for discovery as well as hand Windows discovery jobs off to the WDS, if
applicable. We require that you install at least one RC for any Device42 deployment.

**Windows Discovery Service:** The Windows Discovery Service (WDS) is a .NET service which
runs on a Windows system and makes WMI queries on behalf of the Linux-based RC and MA. If
you’ll be running Windows discoveries, you must deploy at least one WDS instance and connect it to
an RC.

**Discovery Agent:** The Device42 Discovery Agent can be optionally deployed into your
environment. It is typically deployed either on devices like laptops that are not consistently
connected to your corporate network or in segmented network environments where agentless
discovery is not permitted or possible. The Device42 Agent can run on Windows, macOS, Linux,
and other Unix-based operating systems.

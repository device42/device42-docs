Welcome to the Device42 installation guide. This page outlines installing Device42 for the purposes of mapping and gaining insight into your IT environment.

## Getting Started

Device42 is delivered as a virtual appliance, which you install on a virtualization platform.

Before you begin:
- Review the [sizing recommendations](sizing-recommendations.mdx) to ensure your environment is properly provisioned.
- Visit the [security posture and high-level permissions](security-posture-and-high-level-permissions.mdx) page.
- See the [discovery port configurations](discovery-port-configurations.mdx) for network requirements.

## Installation Process Overview

Device42 consists of three components to install. First, install the Device42 Main Appliance (the Device42 application and user interface), followed by the Remote Collector (RC) and Windows Discovery Service (WDS). 

When you run a discovery, the Device42 MA uses the WDS to collect information about Windows environments and uses the RC to collect information about all other IT environments.

See the next [Resource and Deployment Architecture](resource-and-deployment-architecture-overview.mdx) page for more information about these core Device42 components and how they fit together.

After you install the Main Appliance, RC, and WDS, you can install the [Device42 NetFlow Collector](installing-the-d42-netflow-collector-as-a-service.mdx) to improve [Application Dependency Mapping](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/index.mdx) discovery.

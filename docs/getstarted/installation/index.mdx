Welcome to the Device42 installation guide. This page outlines installing Device42 for the purposes of mapping and gaining insight into your IT environment.

## Getting Started

Device42 is delivered as a virtual appliance to be installed on a virtualization platform.

Before you begin:
- Review the [sizing recommendations](sizing-recommendations.mdx) to ensure your environment is properly provisioned.
- Visit the [security posture and high-level permissions](security-posture-and-high-level-permissions.mdx) page.
- See the [discovery port configurations](discovery-port-configurations.mdx) for network requirements.

## Installation Process Overview

Device42 consists of three main components that need to be installed. First, install the Device42 Main Appliance (the Device42 application and user interface) followed by the Remote Collector (RC) and Windows Discovery Service (WDS). 

The RC and WDS are used to collect information about the IT environment during discovery. The WDS is used for discovery in Windows environments and the RC is used for everything else.

For explanations of these Device42 components, see the next [Resource and Deployment Architecture](resource-and-deployment-architecture-overview.mdx) page.

After installing the Main Appliance, RC, and WDS, you can install the [Device42 NetFlow Collector](installing-the-d42-netflow-collector-as-a-service.mdx) to improve [Application Dependency Mapping](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/index.mdx) discovery.

The section outlines how Device42 ensures data security in transit and at rest, emphasizing the principle of least privilege in agentless discovery.

## Security Posture

- All data in transit from Windows Discovery Service (WDS) to Remote Collector (RC), and RC to Main Appliance (MA) is transferred via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or HTTPS.
- All data stays at rest within the MA in an end-user environment.
- Only data voluntarily shared by the end user leaves the premises.

## Required Permissions

Device42 uses the principle of least privilege in its agentless discovery.

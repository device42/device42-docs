### Overview

The Device42 Main Appliance (MA) is available on Amazon Web Services (AWS), either as a manual installation or through the AWS Marketplace.

The Device42 Remote Collector (RC) is only available via manual installation only. To request access, please submit a ticket to the Device42 RC Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and include the following information:

- The AWS region for Device42 deployment
- The AWS account number

The Device42 AWS offering involves an EC2 instance that houses the Device42 MA, Appliance Manager (AM), and RC.

### Costs and Licensing

Each Device42 AWS offering comes with a pre-installed limited license. To use the full capabilities of Device42, we recommend you obtain a more comprehensive license from a Device42 sales representative or business partner.

Refer to the Device42 [Licensing](administration/licensing.mdx#upload-a-new-license) page for more information on managing licenses.

Device42 on AWS operates using the **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** model, meaning you can run on AWS with no additional charge from Device42. Other than the yearly fee for your Device42 license, the only costs you will incur via AWS are the charges they bill you for the use of your instances. These are usually hourly fees, depending on the instance size you select; larger instances generally cost more.

Device42 license pricing information is available on the [Device42 Pricing](https://www.device42.com/pricing/) page.

### EC2 Instance Sizing for Device42

When running Device42 on AWS, we recommended you size your Device42 MA to run on a **t3.xlarge** EC2 instance. During appliance configuration on the AWS Marketplace, you will have the option to select your EC2 instance size. The **t3.xlarge** EC2 instance size is the default and is currently the only instance size permitted.

The configuration will only allow you to **Launch** successfully using one of the sizes listed above.

Customers must regularly view and manage the quotas for AWS services using the AWS Service Quotas dashboard.

Refer to our [Sizing Recommendations](getstarted/installation/sizing-recommendations.mdx) page for sizing recommendations.

## Deploying Device42 From the AWS Marketplace

### Configuring Instance and Communication Settings

Launch your Device42 instance via the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=Device42&ref_=device42) one-click feature and follow the on-screen instructions.

When you arrive at the **Launch this software** screen, select a key pair to use for SSH console access to the Device42 MA and allow incoming access from your external IP address:

- Click **Create a key pair in EC2** to generate a key. See the [Generating a new AWS key pair](#generating-a-new-aws-key-pair-for-ssh-access) section for more help with this step.
    
  ![Select SSH key pair to use for console access to Device42 on AWS](/assets/images/choose_SSH_keypair_AWSd42-hl.png)

- Create an appropriate security group via **Security Group Settings**, select **Create new based on seller settings**, and add your external IP address as an allowed IP for the default Device42 ports: `404 ssh`, `4242 appmgr-http`, `4343 appmgr-https`, and `443 https`.
  
  These ports are part of the default Device42 AMI security group settings for incoming SSH, Appliance Manager, and web UI access.
    
  ![security group settings for access to Device42 on AWS](/assets/images/security_group_settings_CORRECT-hl.png)

:::note
This allows traffic from your PC and local network to facilitate communication with the deployed Device42 instance **directly over the internet**. This is not considered best practice and should only be used for testing. Set up a VPN or other secure means of communication for production AWS use.
:::

SSH to the public endpoint of your new Device42 MA using the public DNS name or the IP address found in the AWS UI, ensuring your SSH client is configured to connect on port 404:

- Use `device42` as the username.
- Instead of a password, use the SSH key file you selected on the **Launch this software** screen for SSH authentication.
- Configure your instance's [security group settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html) to allow SSH access from your PC's IP address.

  ![Instance ID, public ip, DNS address on EC2 dash](/assets/images/EC2_dashboard_Instance_ID-IP-DNS_hl.png)

Navigate to the Device42 login screen by visiting `https://Device42_AWS_address` **(1)**:

- `Device42_AWS_address` is the DNS name (preferred) or IP address found on the AWS UI.
- Log in to the Device42 web UI using `admin` as your username and your AWS instance ID **(2)** as your temporary password.

  It's a good idea to change these credentials to something more secure as soon as you log in!

      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/installation-amazon-web-services/d42-login-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }} 
  />

Update the appliance license key, as the included key is expired:

- Obtain an updated license by sending an email to [sales@device42.com](mailto:sales@device42.com) requesting a trial license for an AWS Marketplace Device42 installation.
- When you receive the updated key file, save it to your local filesystem and go to **Tools > Settings > Licensing**. Browse to the new key file **(1)** and click the **Upload & Apply** button **(2)**.

  <ThemedImage
  alt="Update license Device42 AWS"
  sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/installation-amazon-web-services/upload-license-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/installation-amazon-web-services/upload-license-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '90%' }} 
  />

Make sure your AMI is running the latest version of Device42 and update it if necessary:

- From the Device42 web UI, head to **Tools > Update**.
- Make note of the **Current Main Appliance Version** number displayed.
- Then, follow the **Check for latest version** link or visit [https://www.device42.com/update/](https://www.device42.com/update/) to check for an update.
- If the update page offers a newer release, enter your work email and install the update by following the [Device42 Upgrade Steps](https://support.device42.com/hc/en-us/en-us/articles/222221228-Upgrade-Steps-Device42). If you're working with a new appliance with no data, skip the backup step.

    <ThemedImage
    alt="Check for Device42 Update"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/installation-amazon-web-services/update-software-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/installation-amazon-web-services/update-software-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '70%' }} 
    />

And you're all set! Now is a good time to check out our documentation for [Getting Started](getstarted/index.mdx) with Device42.

### Generating a New AWS Key Pair for SSH Access

To generate a new SSH key pair for use on AWS, you first need to access the **Key Pairs** page using one of the following options:

- Click **Create a key pair in EC2** during the configuration of your appliance.
- Open the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home), scroll to the **Network & Security** section of the left-hand menu, and choose **Key Pairs**.

![Create an new SSH key pair on AWS EC2](/assets/images/create_AWS_keypair_for_SSH.png)

On the **Key Pairs** page, take the following steps:

1. Click the **Create Key Pair**" button (1).
2. In the dialog that pops up, give your new key pair a meaningful name.
3. Click the **Create** button.

    Your key file will be created and the private key will begin downloading automatically. Save it somewhere safe.
    
    The `FileName.pem` file contains the **private key** that you'll use for authentication. If you are using Linux, copy it to your key directory.

4. To use your new SSH key with PuTTY on Windows, reference this helpful AWS article: [Connect to your Linux instance using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-from-windows.html).

### Appliance Manager Access â€” AWS Marketplace Installation

All maintenance operations are performed through the Device42 Appliance Manager (AM). The AM listens on port 4343 (for example, `https://YOUR\_DEVICE42\_INSTANCE:4343`) **(1)**.

Software updates, Device42 backups and restores, and certificate management are all performed through the AM:

<img src={loginImg} width="65%" />

For one-click installations from the AWS Marketplace, log in to the AM using the following credentials **(2)**:

- **Username:** `d42admin` 
- **Password:** [Your AWS instance ID]
  
Once logged in, you'll see the AM main menu:

![D42 Appliance Manager menu](/assets/images/installation-amazon-web-services/appliance-manager.png)

## Deploying a Downloaded Image to an AWS Instance â€” Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin:

1. Please submit a ticket requesting access to the Device42 AMI. Be certain to include the following information:
    - The AWS region for Device42 deployment
    - The AWS account number
2. After Device42 Support has granted you access to the Device42 AMI, navigate to your EC2 Dashboard and launch a new instance.
3. Select **My AMIs**, choose **Shared with Me**, and deploy your appliance. **Device42 recommends `t3.xlarge` as the instance size.**

### Appliance Manager Access: Manual Installation

For manual (image-based) AWS installations, you can log in to the AM using the default Device42 credentials:

- Username: `d42admin`
- Password: `default`

## Instance Access Security

Given the nature of discovery and the inherent access it requires, Device42 does not recommend direct access from unrestricted internet sources. Instead, we recommend you use VPN connections and security groups to protect access to the Device42 instance. While these requirements will vary from environment to environment, we recommend strict adherence to the principle of least privilege.

For additional visibility, Device42 recommends users enable [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html) as a security and operational best practice.

## Administration of Device42 on AWS

### Software and Security Updates and Patches

Security patches are bundled with Device42 software updates. There is no need to manually apply patches to your Device42 instances outside of software updates. Software updates can be downloaded from the [Device42 update page](https://www.device42.com/update/).

Watch the [How To Update the Device42 Appliance](/how-to-videos/update-device42-appliance-how-to) walkthrough video for information on our quick update process.

### Backing Up and Restoring Device42 Data on AWS

The Device42 backup facilities are accessible through the AM. Backups can be executed immediately. You can download a backup file immediately or schedule automatic saving to an SFTP, NFS, or AWS S3 destination.

For more information on backing up and restoring Device42 data, see our guide to [setting up backups](administration/appliance-manager/setting-up-backup-device42-appliance-manager.mdx).

### Monitoring and Health Checks for Device42 on AWS

Device42 has a built-in health check that can be polled using your favorite monitoring tool. We offer a preconfigured [Device42 Health Check module for Nagios](https://github.com/device42/Device42-Nagios-Health-Check).

The built-in health check monitors the following:

<table><tbody><tr><td width="288"><ul><li>Backup Status</li><li>CPU Usage</li><li>Database (DB) size</li><li>Disk Usage Percent</li></ul></td><td width="288"><ul><li>Free Memory (MB)</li><li>Free Swap Memory (MB)</li><li>Total Memory (MB)</li><li>Total Swap Memory (MB)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

![Device42 Nagios Healthcheck Sample Output](/assets/images/nagios_healthcheck_example.png)

### Configuring High Availability for Device42 on AWS

If a High Availability (HA) deployment of Device42 is desired or required for a Device42 instance running on AWS, Device42 offers a supported **Warm HA** solution. To configure your deployment to run Warm HA, failover, and (if desired) automatic backups, follow the instructions in the [Device42 Warm HA documentation](administration/appliance-manager/warm-ha-setup-failover-and-automated-backups.mdx).

The documentation also includes an example configuration that leverages Nagios to automatically fail over the instance in case of a failure.

### Cross-Instance Discovery - Sample IAM Policy

:::note
The following sample IAM policy is **not** needed to simply run Device42 on AWS. You would only set up an IAM policy similar to this if you wanted to **target** your AWS inventory for discovery (to document your AWS deployment in Device42). No IAM policy is necessary to **run** Device42 in AWS nor to discover infrastructure running elsewhere.
:::

Visit the Device42 [support page](https://support.device42.com/) to open a ticket or reach out to [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com) if you have any more questions.

The following permissions are required to support discovery:

<table><tbody><tr><td width="288"><ul><li>AmazonEc2ReadOnly</li><li>AmazonElastiCacheReadOnlyAccess</li></ul></td><td width="288"><ul><li>AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess</li><li>AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

The following is a sample IAM policy (with minimum appropriate permissions) that allows Device42 to discover and inventory instances running on AWS. You may modify it, but we recommend that you only use it if you understand it:

```json

            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Security, Privacy, and Other Considerations

- The Device42 AWS offering does not restrict the Instance Metadata Service version.
- The Device42 AWS offering does not require AWS data encryption to operate properly.  
- Customer data resides on the instance itself. Customer passwords and secrets are encrypted with AES-256 encryption.

  Refer to the Device42 [Secrets, Security, and Permissions](administration/passwords/password-security-and-permissions.mdx) page for additional information on how passwords and secrets are stored.

- The Device42 AWS offering does not require the storage of any secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.

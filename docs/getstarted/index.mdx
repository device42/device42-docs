Welcome to **The Hitchhiker's Guide to Device42**, AKA the Device42 docs site. 

The following pages contain answers to the ultimate questions about infrastructure, the data center, and everything _(and the answers to many common Device42 questions, too)_.

Navigate through the Device42 documentation topics using the left-hand navigation bar or the search box found hanging out at the top right of the page - in much the same way that bricks don't.

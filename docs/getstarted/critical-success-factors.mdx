We have helped thousands of customers implement Device42, and have not only learned the best way to implement Device42 but have also learned customer best practices that help ensure a quick and successful implementation. Please give careful consideration to each of the critical success factors below.

## Have Clarity of Purpose

Gain internal consensus regarding your initial Device42 implementation goals, defining what "success" means. This will help focus the Device42 implementation.

## Identify Supporting Departments and Persons

Your Device42 implementation will likely require support from persons residing in various other departments within your organization. This document details the information and tasks required to implement Device42, and it is your responsibility to determine who to enlist for support and to help ensure their timely support.

## Leverage Executive Sponsors

Have Project Stakeholders and Executive Sponsors reach out to the leaders of departments from which you require assistance and convey the following:

- An overview of the project, including its goals
- The value the project will provide to the business
- The role their department will play in the project's success

This step will help ensure you get the support you require.

## Share Information and Documentation

Device42 provides a wealth of documentation at https://docs.device42.com/, including documentation and videos linked to in this guide. Encourage others to access this online documentation as it will likely include answers to questions they have. Device42 users also have access to Device42 Academy, which includes a variety of courses, including courses in implementing Device42. We encourage you to contact us and sign up for classes.

## Get Project Management Assistance if Necessary

It can sometimes be difficult to manage an implementation that requires coordination between different departments or persons, particularly when you are also the implementation Technical Lead. Project Managers can help facilitate meetings, can help hold persons accountable for deliverables, and can escalate to management when required.

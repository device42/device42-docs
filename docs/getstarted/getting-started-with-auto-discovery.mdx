In the Discover phase you will configure, execute, and schedule jobs that discover your IT landscape and collect and store the associated data. These discovery jobs systematically scan and inventory your IT infrastructure, using Device42's automatic discovery capabilities to populate the database. This includes everything from network devices to software, applications, and storage.

:::tip
This is the second phase (Discover) in the Device42 implementation process. See [How is Device42 Implemented?](/getstarted/how-is-device42-implemented.mdx) for an overview of all four phases.
:::

This phase is broken down into four tasks:
- **Task 1:** Prepare for Discovery Jobs
- **Task 2:** Create and Run Discovery Jobs
- **Task 3:** Verify Discovery Jobs
- **Task 4:** Schedule Discovery Jobs

Note that the Verify and Schedule tasks can be performed immediately following Task 2 (Create and Run Discovery Jobs for each discovery job) instead of validating and scheduling after running all the discovery jobs.

## Discovery Job Best Practices

Below is a list of basic discovery job best practices. While [this list](/auto-discovery/autodisc-best-practices.mdx) is long, discovery is the foundation of Device42, and it is therefore important that you understand and implement these best practices. We recommend you refer back to this list often.

### Discovery Job Best Practices: Discovery Job Planning

1. **Limit your discovery focus:** There are a variety of discovery jobs and it is tempting to immediately run as many as possible. Focus on the jobs that will deliver the maximum value to your organization; these typically include jobs like SNMP, Virtualization, Windows, Linux and Unix, Cloud, Storage, and Certificate. You can run additional discovery jobs once the core jobs have been created and scheduled.

2. **Organize your discovery jobs:** There are different discovery job types (for example SNMP, Hypervisor, Windows, Linux, Cloud, Storage, and so on) and each of these will likely have multiple jobs based on location, Data Center, Region, and so on, or due to the large number of items to be discovered. Consider how you want to organize each discovery job type. For example, you may conclude it is best to have a separate Windows discovery job for each location or Data Center. Take into account the recommended maximum number of devices a Remote Collector supports when organizing your jobs.

3. **Adopt a standard discovery job naming convention:** Name each discovery job so they are easily understandable, are consistent, and can be sorted in a way that will be useful.


### Discovery Job Best Practices: Discovery Job Configuration

1. **Do not set up an autodiscovery scan using critical production account credentials**; create a separate, dedicated account used only for discovery. Account lock-out could result in an otherwise avoidable outage depending on your permissions and configured password policies. You as a customer are responsible for any such behavior.

2. **Always leverage a Remote Collector** when performing discovery jobs. Note this is required when scanning networks larger than `/24`, using Nmap and leveraging any of our modular offerings such as: Application Dependency Mapping (ADM), Resource Utilization (RU), Storage Discovery, and Power and Environmental Monitoring.

3. For each discovery job, **be as specific as possible** in terms of defining your discovery targets (for example, your devices), excluding any targets that should not be discovered. Doing so will reduce the number of discovery failures.

4. **Do not exceed the largest recommended network range of `/16`**, which includes 65,534 IP addresses. Adding more than the recommended range may either yield inconsistent discovery results or lengthen the time required for the discovery job to complete.

5. Break down larger subnets into smaller subnets, and leverage additional RCs to optimize discovery performance for larger environments.

### Discovery Job Best Practices: Discovery Job Scheduling

1. **Schedule your discovery jobs**. Discovery jobs that are created, run once, and never scheduled to run again result in stale information and an inaccurate inventory.

2. **Confirm job health before scheduling**. Make sure your discovery jobs return the expected data before you schedule them to run.

3. **Schedule discovery jobs to run with the level of frequency required** to keep your data current. Different jobs will require different frequencies based on their rate of data change.

4. **Confirm that scheduled discovery jobs are complete before they are scheduled to run next**. For example, a discovery job scheduled to run every four hours completes in less than four hours.

5. **Avoid running jobs during high network traffic hours**; this can reduce impact to network performance.

6. When running multiple jobs during a day, **schedule them to run evenly throughout the day**. If you cannot run jobs during primary business or production hours, spread them across non-peak, non-business hours as evenly as possible.

7. Regularly view the **Scheduled Job Distribution Status** report to ensure your jobs are not overloaded (**Insights+ > System Administration > Scheduled Job Distribution Status**).

## Discover Tasks

### Task 1: Prepare for Discovery Jobs

#### 1.1 Collect and Store Discovery Credentials

Credentials ([Secrets](/administration/passwords/password-security-and-permissions/)) are frequently required when performing agentless Discovery; you specify them when creating discovery jobs. It is important to store the correct credentials in Device42 so you can reference them for jobs that require them. 

Incorrect credentials is a common reason why discovery jobs do not successfully complete. Make sure you have the correct credentials and that you enter them correctly.

Here are some examples of credentials required for common discovery jobs:
- **SNMP Discovery:** Requires SNMP Community String (SNMP GET read account)
- **Linux Discovery:** Requires SSH Login
- **Windows Discovery:** Requires Windows Services Account (WMI access to devices)

Secrets are centrally stored in **Resources > Secrets > All Secrets**; note they are only visible to the user who created them but can be shared.

#### 1.2 Create Subnets

Adding subnets helps you define the network scope as you discover your network(s) and also reduces the number of `undefined 0.0.0.0` network types.

To add your Subnets, perform the following steps:
1. Go to **Resources > Networks > All Subnets** and click **Create** in the top-right corner.
2. Enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address into the **Network** field.
3. Enter the **Mask Bits** (omit the `/`).
4. Enter the **Service Level**.
5. Review the remaining options and choose the items that best fit your needs.
6. Click the **Save** button.

<ThemedImage
alt="View or edit existing subnets"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/getting-started-with-auto-discovery/subnets-list-page-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/getting-started-with-auto-discovery/subnets-list-page-19.06-dark.png'),
}}
/>

The required fields are **Network**, **Mask Bits**, and **Service Level**. The other fields are optional. If left empty, **Range Begin** and **Range End** are automatically calculated based on the **Network** and **Mask Bits**.

<ThemedImage
alt="Create a new subnet"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/getting-started-with-auto-discovery/add-subnet-19.06-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/getting-started-with-auto-discovery/add-subnet-19.06-dark.png'),
}}
/>

If subnets have been predefined, all discovered IP addresses will be placed in their respective subnets. Otherwise, the IPs will end up in an **undefined** subnet.

Click [here](/infrastructure-management/ipam/subnets.mdx) for more information about subnets, including detailed instructions for adding or editing a subnet.

#### 1.3 Configure Ports to Discovery Targets

It is critical that the ports used to access the targets are open in advance of running discovery jobs. Click [here](/getstarted/deploy-device42/discovery-port-configurations.mdx) for a list of all ports that may be used to access targets for discovery, along with their directionality.

### Task 2: Create and Run Discovery Jobs

#### Discovery Job Order

Device42 strongly recommends you run your first discovery jobs in the order listed below; you will achieve the best results and it will minimize future reconciliation work. You can skip any jobs that are not applicable to your organization.

| Order | Discovery | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Network (SNMP) | Uses Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to build your L2 Network landscape by discovering and gathering information from network devices such as switches, routers, and printers, collecting hardware and connectivity details.

| 9 | UCS/Load Balancer | Discovers Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) and Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) environments, as well as load balancers like F5. It collects detailed configuration and performance data. Use [this document](/auto-discovery/load-balancer-f5-autodiscovery/#load-balancer-discovery) to help get you started. |

#### 2.1 Create SNMP Discovery Jobs

SNMP discovery jobs capture network equipment data per unique IP Address, CIDR block, or IP Range responding to SNMP get requests on Port 161.

SNMP discovery will discover network switches, storage switches, basic SAN details, management interfaces (iLO, iDRAC, and so on) and load balancer details. The Main Appliance will then federate newly discovered devices and details with other configuration items in Device42 allowing you to map connectivity across the network. The SAN discovery will also allow you to see which SANs are attached to a fiber switch when their WWNs are discovered. Discovery of various management interfaces will bring in BMC details and associate them with their affiliated hypervisor/bare-metal servers in Device42. 

Device42 supports SNMP v1, v2c and v3.

**Port and Credential Requirements**

**Ports:** UDP Port 161 should be accessible on any of the SNMP targets from the Device42 Remote Collectors.

**Credentials:** Read-only credentials are required for SNMP discovery jobs.

**Steps to Create and Run an SNMP Discovery Job**

To create and run an SNMP Discovery Job, perform the following steps:
1. Navigate to **Discovery > SNMP**.
2. Click the **Create** button.
3. Enter the **Job name**.
4. Select the **Remote Collector**.
5. Enter the **Server or Servers**, **CIDR Block**, or **IP Range**.
6. Review the remaining options and choose the items that best fit your needs.
7. Add the credentials.
8. Click the **Save** button.
9. Click the checkbox next to the discovery job(s) and choose **Actions > Run Selected Jobs**.

:::

#### 2.3 Create Windows Discovery Jobs

Windows discovery jobs provide an accurate inventory of the Windows devices on your target network.

While your virtual infrastructure can be discovered via VMWare, Hypervisor, etc. discovery jobs, Windows discovery jobs perform an OS-level discovery of your Windows devices, including your virtual Windows servers. Windows Discovery of physical infrastructure can be done either via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), an older and less secure discovery method, or Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which is newer and more secure.

**Port and Credential Requirements**

There are a number of prerequisites and requirements for Windows discovery jobs to run properly, including WinRM Network Requirements, WMI Network Requirements, WMI and Windows Permissions, and Port Requirements. **It is imperative that the prerequisites and the requirements are met prior to running Windows discovery jobs.** 

Click [here](https://docs.device42.com/auto-discovery/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery/#permission-requirements-for-wmi-and-windows) for these requirements and prerequisites, and also for more detailed instructions on creating and running Windows discovery jobs. This should be your first place to look when troubleshooting Windows discovery job issues.

**Steps to Create and Run a Windows Discovery Job**

To create and run a Windows discovery job, perform the following steps:
1. Choose **Discovery > HyperVisors / \*nix / Windows**.
2. Click the **Create** button.
3. Enter the **Job name**.
4. Select the **Remote Collector**.
5. Select the **Windows Platform**.
6. Enter the **Server or Servers**, **CIDR Block**, or **IP Range**.
7. Add the Discovery Target(s) Credential(s) (that is, Username and Password).
8. Review the remaining options and choose the items that best fit your needs.
9. Click the **Save** button.
10. Click the checkbox next to the discovery job(s) and choose **Actions > Run Selected Jobs**.

**Note:**

- There are sometimes failures when discovering Windows operating system-based devices. Use the [Windows Discovery Troubleshooting](/auto-discovery/windows-discovery-troubleshooting.mdx) guide to help you investigate and resolve these failures. If you are unable to resolve these failures, please contact Device42 Support for assistance.
- Organizations that have purchased the Software License Management module can include Software discovery when running Windows discovery jobs by clicking the **Discover Software** checkbox within the Software and Applications section of the job. For more information regarding Software License Management with Device42, see the Software License Management Discovery Jobs section later in this document.
- Do not initially configure Windows discovery jobs to collect ADM information. There are two reasons for this: **1)** You may inadvertently consume your ADM licenses by discovering the wrong devices. **2)** We recommend you wait ~30 days before enabling ADM.
  
  - Set **ADM Sampling** to **Off**. Note: This is enabled by default when licensed for Enterprise Application Discovery and Services Discovery. If you do not set ADM Sampling to **Off** you will have to perform multiple 'cleanup' steps.

#### 2.9 Create UCS/Load Balancer Discovery Jobs

UCS/Load Balancer discovery jobs map out virtual servers, pools, and their relationships to backend devices. Once you have run SNMP and Windows/*nix discovery jobs, you can create UCS/Load Balancer jobs to collect connectivity and dependency data.

**Prerequisites**

For F5 discovery, ensure you have the **username for a local account** with access to the F5 API. The API calls work with read-only access and do not require administrative privileges.

Note that F5 devices do not support username and password authentication for accounts that use external authentication providers, such as Active Directory, which uses token-based authentication.

**Steps to Create and Run a Load Balancer and Cluster Device (UCS) Discovery Job**

Given the variety of Discovery platforms, we recommend you click [here](/auto-discovery/load-balancer-f5-autodiscovery.mdx) to follow the steps to create these jobs. This page also includes prerequisites and discovery options. To run the created job, click the checkbox next to the discovery job(s) and choose **Actions > Run Selected Jobs**.

### Task 3: Verify Discovery Jobs

There are a variety of ways for you to evaluate the success of a discovery job. These include:
- **Discovery Job Results Status:** Provides a status of the overall job, displaying successes, failures, warnings, and other results.
- **Discovery Scores:** Provides a score for one or all discovery jobs.
- **Discovery Target Details:** Provides discovery results and scores for individual targets (e.g. server).

#### 3.1 Discovery Job Results

After running a discovery job you will be presented with the Job Status. 

<ThemedImage

- You can click the **Show** link next to **Advanced Status**, **Detailed Discovery Scores**, and **Detailed Queue Scores** sections for additional details.

### Task 4: Schedule Discovery Jobs

#### 4.1 Scheduling a Discovery Job

Once a discovery job has been run and validated, it can be scheduled to automatically run. In the **Autodiscovery Schedule** section of each job, you can set as many different autodiscovery schedules as required to cover your environment. You can choose specific times and days of the week to run the autodiscovery job.

**Steps to Schedule a Discovery Job**

To schedule an existing discovery job, perform the following steps:
1. Choose **Discovery**, then choose the type of discovery job you want to schedule.
2. Click the name of the job you want to schedule.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Scroll to the **Autodiscovery Schedule** section and click the **+ Add another Autodiscover Schedule** link.
5. Specify the schedule you want.
6. Click the **Save** button.

<ThemedImage
alt="Schedule discovery job"
sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/getting-started-with-auto-discovery/job-schedule-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/getting-started-with-auto-discovery/job-schedule-dark.png'),
}}

## Discovery and Unprocessed Device Records

Unprocessed device records are discovered devices that could not be confidently matched to any existing device records based on the system's device matching criteria. This most commonly happens when using "Moderate" or "Conservative" matching levels, in which the system considers multiple data points (such as hostname, IP address, MAC address, serial number, and UUID) and requires a certain combined score to merge with an existing record. If this threshold is not met, the discovered device ends up as "unprocessed" and requires manual review or action.

Users can review these records and either merge them with existing assets, create a new record, or delete them if they are outdated or incorrectly discovered.

To view Unprocessed Device Records, hover over **Discovery**, then choose **Unprocessed Device Records**.

**Unprocessed Device Records Best Practices**

1. Regularly check the **Unprocessed Device Records** page.
2. Merge records that clearly belong to existing assets, and delete old or stale records. Implement Auto Clean rules to delete old or stale records when appropriate.
3. Update discovery credentials and methods if frequent unprocessed records indicate incomplete data collection or matching failures.
4. In environments where matching is challenging, switching to "classic" device matching level can reduce the incidence of unprocessed records.

Click [here](/auto-discovery/unprocessed-device-records.mdx) for more information about Unprocessed Device Records, including defining matching levels, enabling Enhanced Device Matching, and other information.

## Discovery and Auto Clean Rules

AutoClean Rules enable you to automatically manage old and possibly stale data based on specific criteria you set. Data pertaining to objects (e.g a device or an IP address) that is not found in subsequent autodiscovery jobs can be automatically deleted, architect, or otherwise modified. Auto Clean rules are particularly relevant for cleaning up IP Addresses, Devices, and Software. Click [here](/administration/auto-clean-feature.mdx) for more information on adding Auto Clean rules, including instructions to create new rules.

## Additional Discovery Information

Click [here](/auto-discovery/index.mdx) to view the Autodiscovery main page, where you will find a wealth of autodiscovery information. This should be the first place to look for autodiscovery questions you may still have. It also includes a long list of sub-pages for each job discovery type.

## Software License Management Discovery Jobs

### Overview

As mentioned earlier in this document, Software License Management (SLM) is a separate Device42 module that among other things, scans Windows, Linux, and other device instances to detect installed software.

SLM is configured by enabling certain options within **HyperVisors / \*nix / Windows** discovery jobs, specifically when the following **Platform** values are chosen:

- *nix
- Classic WinRM
- IBM i/AS400
- IBM z/OS
- SCCM
- Windows

To enable software discovery for these discovery jobs, click the **Software** checkbox within the **Software and Applications** section of the job.

Click [here](/infrastructure-management/software/software-license-management.mdx) to link to a page providing information on how to configure the SLM module, view discovered software, enable software alerting, run software reports, and more.

## The Unknown Device Type

All non-virtual devices will initially be assigned the **unknown** device type during discovery. These devices have a hardware model. The appliance categorizes them as **unknown** because it has not yet been instructed which of the following types the hardware models belong to:

- **Regular:** Represents physical devices.
- **Blade:** Represents blade devices.
- **Other:** Represents "other" devices, like laptops, workstations, and network printers, that aren't rack-mounted.

Once you change a hardware type, all the corresponding devices that refer to that hardware and have been assigned the **unknown** type will automatically be categorized accordingly.

The hardware bulk edit feature allows you to change hardware properties in bulk for all undefined hardware types. It automatically categorizes all devices belonging to a specific category. See the [Bulk Edit video](/how-to-videos/add-and-bulk-edit-hardware-models-how-to.mdx) or [Bulk Edit documentation](/infrastructure-management/devices/hardware-models-templates.mdx) for more information.

Once a hardware type has been defined, any newly imported or discovered devices will go into the correct category.

## Viewing the Details of Discovered Items

To view the details of a discovered item type, navigate to that item type's list page and select an item from the table.

For example, you can go to **Resources > All Devices** and click on a device name to view that device's details. Depending on the device and information available, fields like **Hardware**, **Serial #**, **Total CPUs**, **RAM**, **OS**, and **IP Addresses** may be populated.

## Discover Phase Checklist

The Discover phase is considered complete when:

- You have defined your subnets.
- You have defined the discover jobs that will deliver the maximum return to your organization.
- You have determined how you want to organize and name your discovery jobs.
- You have created and run your discovery jobs, making sure to include only those targets relevant to each job, and making sure to limit the quantity of targets to ensure the jobs successfully complete.
- You have viewed your Unprocessed Device Records and have taken the appropriate actions (e.g. delete records, merge records).
- You have verified your discovery jobs were successful by reviewing Discovery Job results, Discovery Scores, and Discover Target Details.
- You have scheduled your discovery jobs, making sure to run them only as frequently as is needed, to schedule them during times when it will have minimal network impact, and to schedule jobs to run on different days and at different times so as to not overwhelm the Main Appliance.

## Discover Phase Support

At the conclusion of the Discover phase you should have created and configured your relevant discovery jobs, validated that the jobs ran successfully, and scheduled those jobs to automatically run at specific intervals.

You may access the [Device42 Support page](https://support.device42.com) where you can submit a request, access our Knowledge Base, or access other general information.

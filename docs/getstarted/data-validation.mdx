In the Data Validation phase you will verify the quality and reliability of the discovered data. You will compare discovered data against existing reliable data sources in order to confirm the discovered data is accurate, complete, and consistent. If you find data that is missing (for example, missing devices), blank (for example, missing Model Name), or incorrect (for example, incorrect hostname), we recommend you contact Device42 Support at [https://support.device42.com/](https://support.device42.com/) for help.

## Data Validation Methods

There are three primary methods for reviewing discovered Device42 data, so that it can be compared against other data sources—viewing individual records, exporting data in bulk, and generating reports.

### Viewing Individual Records

To view individual records, perform the following steps:

1. Hover over **Resources**, then click the item you wish to view (for example, **All Devices**)
2. Click on the name of the item whose data you wish to view

### Exporting Data in Bulk

To export data in bulk that can later be reviewed, perform the following steps:

1. Hover over **Tools**, then click **Exports (CSV)**
2. Click the name of the item whose data you want to export (for example, **Device**)

### Generating Reports

There are several useful reports to validate discovered data. To run these reports, perform the following steps:

1. Click **Insights+**
2. Click the folder and report you want to use; for example:
   - **Modernization > Compute** to review Utilization, Hardware, and Operating System information
   - **Compliance/Audit > Environmental Summary** to review physical and virtual devices, OS and version information, and installed software package information
   - **IT Service Delivery > Insights+ Overview** to see an overall view of your IT enterprise

## Data Validation and Data Import

While Device42's CMDB is primarily updated through discovery jobs, it can also be updated by way of manual entry, data import, or via API.

### Manual Entry

To add or update data manually, perform the following steps:

1. Hover over **Resources**, click on the category of items you want to update (for example, **All Devices**).
2. Click the item you want to update.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Enter the information.
5. Click the **Save** button.

### Data Import

To bulk import data, perform the following steps:

1. Hover over **Tools**, then choose **Imports/Exports (xls)** under the **Templates & Bulk Operations** section.
2. Either click the Sample File you want to use for import or download the Current Data for that data category.
3. Open the downloaded file and add or update the data.
4. Click the **Choose File** button and select the file containing the data you want to import.
5. Click the **Import** button.

**Note:** You can also bulk import your existing data from different spreadsheet formats by mapping columns to D42 fields using the tool linked [here](https://www.device42.com/bulk-data-management/).

### API Import

Restful APIs are supported in Device42 as one of the primary methods of entering, editing and retrieving data. Click [here](https://api.device42.com/) to access the Device42 API Guide.

## Data Validation Phase Checklist

The Data Validation phase is considered complete when:

- You have reviewed the discovered data by reviewing individual records, by exporting data in bulk and reviewing this data, and/or by running reports
- You have compared the discovered data against existing, trusted data sources in an effort to confirm all data instances were discovered and that all data field values are as expected
- You have investigated and resolved any inconsistencies between the discovered data and your existing, trusted data sources
- You have imported any data you want in Device42 that was not able to be discovered.

## Data Validation Phase Support

At the conclusion of Phase 3 you should have confirmed the accuracy of your discovered data.

You may access the Device42 Support page [here](https://support.device42.com/hc/en-us), where you can submit a request, access our Knowledge Base, or access other general information.

## Data Validation and Data Integration

Customers often want to integrate Device42 discovered data with other systems, like Freshservice, Jira Service Management, ServiceNow, or others. We recommend you establish these integrations after you have completed the Data Validation phase. Once you have established these integrations, we recommend you use available mapping/schema data source information to confirm all relevant Device42 data has been successfully transferred to the destination platform.

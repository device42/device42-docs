This guide walks you through installing the Device42 Main Appliance on the VMware vCenter Server.

## Outline of Installation Steps

1. Download and unzip the compressed Device42 virtual appliance.
2. From the vCenter Server interface, select the unzipped `.ovf` file.
3. Follow the VMware prompts and choose your location, datastore, and NIC.
4. Power on the newly deployed Device42 virtual appliance.
5. Log in to the Device42 console using the default credentials and update the credentials.
6. Configure the static IP address from the console.
7. Set the time zone and configure NTP.
8. Log in to the Device42 web interface from a browser: `https://FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP-address`. Update the login credentials here as well.

## Illustrated Steps for Installing Device42 on vCenter Server

Follow these steps to set up your Device42 instance:

### Download and Unzip Device42

Use 7-Zip to decompress the downloaded Device42 virtual appliance image.

### Deploy Device42 on the vCenter Server

### Log In to the Device42 Console

From the vCenter Server interface, open the VM console for your Device42 appliance. The Device42 console login screen appears automatically.

Log in using the default credentials and change them once you've logged in:

   - **Username:** `device42`
   - **Password:** `adm!nd42` 

### Configure the Static IP Address

From the console, configure the IP address. Use a **static IP** for all production Device42 VMs to avoid connectivity issues.

    Enter your settings on the Device42 IP address configuration screen:

### Create a DNS Entry

This is an optional step: Create a DNS entry for the new IP address of the virtual appliance.

### Set the Time Zone and Configure NTP

After setting a static IP address, [set the time zone and configure NTP](/administration/setting-time-zone-and-ntp.mdx) to ensure autodiscovery scheduling and log history work correctly.

### Log In to the Web Interface

Point your browser to `https://FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP-address`.

Log in to the **web interface** using the default credentials:

    - **Username:** `admin`
    - **Password:** `adm!nd42` 
    
    Please change the username and password as soon as you log in.

You should be up and running, and are now ready to go! If you have any questions that you can't find answers to in the docs, email [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com).

## Using SSH

You can apply Device42 updates and perform other menu-related work using **SSH** via **port 404**. Please note that root login has been disabled.

## Next Steps

Install the Device42 [Remote Collector](../remote-collector-rc-installation.mdx) and [Windows Discovery Service](../windows-discovery-service-installation.mdx) before creating your first discovery job.

You can import data into Device42 using the [Device42 API](https://api.device42.com/) or the [**Import/Export (xls)**](/getstarted/using-device42/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets.mdx) tool.

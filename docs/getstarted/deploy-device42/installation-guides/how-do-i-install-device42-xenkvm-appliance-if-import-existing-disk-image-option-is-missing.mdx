:::info
These are **special case** installation instructions for installing the Device42 appliance on Xen- or KVM-based platforms if the **Import existing disk image** option is missing. Otherwise, please refer to the Device42 [guide to Xen and KVM installation](installation-xen-or-kvm-using-virt-manager.mdx).
:::

## Outline of Alternative Installation

1. Download the Device42 image and use bunzip2 to uncompress the image.
2. Create a new virtual machine using the **Network Boot** option and complete the installation wizard setup. 
3. Disable **Network (PXE)** from the Device42 virtual machine **Boot Options**.
4. Log in to the Device42 console and web interface as described in the [Set Up the Main Appliance](installation-xen-or-kvm-using-virt-manager.mdx#set-up-the-main-appliance-and-log-in) section and later of the Virt-Manager installation page.

## Illustrated Installation Steps

The following alternative installation steps are similar to the [standard Virt-Manager installation](installation-xen-or-kvm-using-virt-manager.mdx), except that you select the **Network Boot** option instead of importing the Device42 image and then disable the network boot. 

### Download and Uncompress with bunzip2

The raw image for Xen or KVM has been compressed using bzip2. When you get the file on the KVM host, run the `bunzip2` command to uncompress the file:

```bash
bunzip2 device42-3.2.3-raw.img.bz2
```

### Create a New Virtual Machine

Once you have uncompressed the downloaded raw image, create a new virtual machine. 

Choose the **Network Boot** option. We'll add the disk later. Make sure you don't have some sort of automated network boot enabled for this machine. You will not see the **Import existing disk image** option.

### Choose OS and Version

Choose **Linux** as the **OS type** and the latest Ubuntu version in the **Version** field.

## Illustrated Steps of Installing Device42 using Virt-Manager

Follow these steps to install the Device42 Main Appliance.

### Download the Image and Uncompress 

The raw image for Xen or KVM has been compressed using bzip2. When you get the file on the KVM host, run the `bunzip2` command to uncompress the file:

```bash
bunzip2 device42-<version>-raw.img.bz2
```

### Create the Virtual Machine

1. Select **Import existing disk image** to create a new virtual machine.  

    If you don't see the option to **Import existing disk Image**, follow the [Alternate Install](how-do-i-install-device42-xenkvm-appliance-if-import-existing-disk-image-option-is-missing.mdx) guide.

   Change the default password after signing in to the appliance console.

3. Configure a static IP address for the Device42 appliance.

4. (Optional) Create a DNS entry for the new IP address for the new virtual appliance.

You can apply updates and perform other menu-related tasks using SSH. Please note that root login has been disabled.

### Set the Time Zone and Configure NTP

After setting a static IP address, [set the time zone and configure NTP](/administration/setting-time-zone-and-ntp.mdx) to ensure autodiscovery scheduling and log history work correctly.

2. Log in to Device42 using the default credentials:
    - **Username:** `admin`
    - **Password:** `adm!nd42` 

    Please change the password as soon as you log in.

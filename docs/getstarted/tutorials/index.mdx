Welcome to Device42! Explore the tutorials in this section to learn the fundamentals of using the Device42 Main Appliance (MA).

Start with the [Introduction to Device42](/getstarted/tutorials/device42-tutorial.mdx), which explains the terminology, object types, and object hierarchy used in Device42 and covers the various ways IT data can be added to and exported from the Device42 MA.

Next, learn how to add sample data to your new Device42 instance using either of the following:

- The [spreadsheets tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets.mdx) shows you how to access and add data to a sample `.xls` file, then re-upload it to add the data to Device42.
- The [API tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-the-api.mdx) demonstrates how to execute a bash script of several curl commands that call the Device42 API to add sample data to Device42.

Complete your introduction with the [UI tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface.mdx). Explore the sample data in the Device42 UI to familiarize yourself with the menu options and data organization.

Once you've completed the tutorials, you can discover more Device42 features in the rest of the [Get Started](/getstarted/) section. If you have any questions, comments, or feature requests, please let us know at [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com).

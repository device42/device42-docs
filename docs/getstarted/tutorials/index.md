Welcome to Device42! The tutorials in this section are designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of using the Device42 Main Appliance.

Start with the [Introduction to Device42](/getstarted/tutorials/device42-tutorial.mdx) page for an explanation of Device42 terminology, object types, and the object hierarchical order. Read about the various ways you can add IT data to and export it from the Device42 Main Appliance.

Next, follow one or both of the tutorials below to add sample data to your new Device42 instance:
- The [spreadsheets tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets.mdx) shows you how to access a sample `.xls` file, add data to it, and re-upload the file to load data to Device42.
- The [API tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-the-api.mdx) introduces the Device42 API by executing a bash script of several curl commands that use APIs to load sample data.

Complete your introduction with the [Device42 user interface tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface.mdx). Explore the sample data in the Device42 UI to get familiar with the menu options and data organization. 

After completing the tutorials, have a look at the pages in the [Get Started](/getstarted/) section to discover more Device42 features. If you have any questions, comments, or feature requests, please let us know at [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com).

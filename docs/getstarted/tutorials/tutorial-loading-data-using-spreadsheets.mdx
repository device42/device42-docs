In this tutorial, you will learn to use the API import feature to load data to the Main Appliance (MA). Any type of data that can be loaded via the Device42 API can be uploaded using the import feature, allowing you to import the most data this way.

To get started, navigate to **Tools > Imports/Exports (xls)**.

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/imports-xls-menu-location-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/imports-xls-menu-location-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
/>

## Workflow Overview

The easiest way to create an API import spreadsheet is to look through the Generic API Import Excel Sheet list page to find the **Type of Import** (3) you need. Click the **Download Sample Excel File** link (4) next to the relevant import type and add your data to it.

To learn about the spreadsheet fields and required parameters, click **View Documentation** (5) to read the API documentation.

Once you have completed the spreadsheet, click the **Browse** button (1). Select the prepared Excel file on your machine and click the blue **Import** button (2) to upload your data.

<ThemedImage

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/import-excel-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/import-excel-page-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '110%' }}
/>

Alternatively, you can click **Download Current Data** (6) to update existing data records with new information. If the **Type of Import** (3) contains the words "Create" or "Update", you can change and add data elements, then upload the spreadsheet using the **Import** button (2).

## Buildings Example

### Prepare the Excel Data

![Loading sample data](/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/building-xls-modified-sample.png)

Let's start by uploading building data. When you open the downloaded sample spreadsheet, you'll see the API URL and HTTP request method on the first two rows. In the above example, these are `/api/1.0/buildings/` and `POST`, respectively.

The third row contains the field names, such as `name`, `address`, and `contact_name`.

The actual data starts from the fourth row onwards. The example shows that two buildings, `New Haven DC` and `New York DC`, are to be uploaded to Device42. If you wanted to load 20 buildings, you would enter the data in rows 4-23 of the spreadsheet.

### Consult the API Docs

As noted in the [API documentation](https://api.device42.com/#Buildings_postBuildings), the name of the building is required, but the rest of the fields are optional and can be left blank.

### Upload the Excel File

From the Generic API Import Excel Sheet list page on the MA, **Browse** to your buildings spreadsheet and click **Import** to upload the data.

You'll see a message indicating a successful upload.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Imports success message"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/success-message-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/success-message-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '110%' }} 
/>

### View the Uploaded Data

Navigate to **Infrastructure > Buildings**. The buildings you added to the spreadsheet will appear on the Buildings list page. You can click on a building **Name** to view its details and edit or add more information to it.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Buildings list page with new data"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/buildings-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/buildings-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}

/>

You can also view the new building data from the **Classic Dashboard** on the home page. In the **Building Statistics** table, click the number across from **Buildings** to go to the Buildings list page.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Buildings list page with new data"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/classic-dashboard-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-loading-data-using-spreadsheets/classic-dashboard-dark.png'),
  }}
  
/>

### Load Related Data

Once you've created buildings, you can load rooms by downloading the **Rooms - Create Rooms** sample spreadsheet and adding room data to it.

A unique `building` name or `building_id` is required to add a new room record, which means that building data needs to be added before room data.

Most of the imports contain similar logical references, so we recommend you upload objects in the following order:

1. Add Buildings
2. Add Rooms
3. Add Vendors
4. Add Racks
5. Add Hardware Models
6. Add Devices
7. Add Devices to Racks
8. Add Assets
9. Add Switches (Devices)
10. Add VLANs
11. Add Subnets
12. Add IP Addresses
13. Add Application Components

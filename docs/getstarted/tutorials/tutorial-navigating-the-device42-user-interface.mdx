## Prerequisites

This tutorial uses sample data added to the Main Appliance (MA) from the [API tutorial](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-the-api.mdx). You can still follow along if you have at least one building record that includes a room with related rack Configuration Items (CIs).

### Light/Dark Themes

The Device42 MA supports light and dark themes, which is set using the theme toggle at the top-right corner of the screen. You can have different instances of the MA with different themes, with your preference remembered via cookies. For example, you can have a light theme for your production instance and a dark theme for QA instance.

## Dashboard View

On the MA homepage, you'll see your dashboard below the notification summary. The dashboard provides summary information and statistics for items added or discovered by Device42. There are multiple dashboard layouts available. The **Insights+ Overview** dashboard is the default option, but you can use the dropdown menu to select the layout that is most useful to you.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Select dashboard"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/select-dashboard-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/select-dashboard-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

If you've followed the [spreadsheets](/getstarted/tutorials/device42-tutorial.mdx) or [API](getstarted/tutorials/tutorial-loading-data-using-the-api.mdx) tutorial or run an autodiscovery job, your dashboard statistics will reflect the new CIs.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/dashboard-stats-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/dashboard-stats-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Click on the building count, or navigate to **Infrastructure > DataCenter > Buildings** to view the Buildings list page.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Buildings list view"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/buildings-list-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/buildings-list-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Click on the **New Haven DC** building, scroll down, and select the **NHDC1** room.

<ThemedImage
    alt="New Haven DC example"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/ellipsis-button-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/ellipsis-button-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Click the ellipsis menu on the **NHDC1** room page and select **Room Layout**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Room Layout button"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/new-haven-example-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/new-haven-example-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

## Room Layout View

The Room Layout page displays the layout of the racks in a room.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Room Layout view"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/room-layout-example-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/room-layout-example-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Under **Display Options**, you can choose which text and color coding to apply to the layout:

- **Rack Display:** Choose the text to include on the rack labels.
- **Rack Color:** Choose between the usage or temperature heatmaps or select a [custom field](/administration/custom-key-value-pairs-explained.mdx).

:::info
See the [Buildings and Rooms](/infrastructure-management/buildings-rooms-and-racks/buildings-and-rooms/#room-layout-view.mdx) documentation to learn more about editing room layouts.
:::

If you have the **DCM Power Module**, you will also see options for power and temperature heat maps.

Now, hover over the rack **NH-DC1-04** example.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Room Layout view"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/nhdc1-hover-box-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/nhdc1-hover-box-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

When you do this, you will see a hover box with detailed information about the rack. Click the **View NH-DC1-04 Layout** link to view the Rack Layout page.

## Rack Layout View

An image of the front of the rack is displayed on the left-hand side of the page, and an image of the back of the rack is displayed on the right.

:::tip
If you want to add a new rack with the kind of information shown below, navigate to **Infrastructure > Racks** and click **+ Add Rack** in top right corner of the Racks list page.
:::

<ThemedImage
    alt="Rack Layout view"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/rack-layout-view-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/rack-layout-view-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

As with the room layout view, if you have the DCM Power Module, you will see options for power and temperature heat maps.

Hover over the **NHCTCC01** device to see details about the device. Note that because NHCTCC01 is a blade chassis, there are hyperlinks that will take you to the details page for each of the individual blades in the chassis.

Now click the **View Topology** link in the bottom right corner of the page.

## Topology Charts

The topology impact chart is a diagram of your physical and virtual machines and the applications they support.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Topology example"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/topology-example-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/topology-example-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

This is a fairly simple example but they can get quite complex. Impact charts are very useful for assessing the impact of losing a particular server. This is helpful for business continuity planning or tracking down the root cause of a production outage.

## The List View

Go to **Resources > All Devices** to view all your devices on the Devices list page.

All Device42 objects have a list view page with tools that allow you to add, filter, search, and perform bulk actions on the objects.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Devices list view"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/devices-list-view-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/devices-list-view-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

The **+ Add** button on the right side of the screen is used to add devices (1).

You'll see several filters that can be applied to reduce the size of the list (2). You can filter by device **Type**, **Hardware** model, **Customers**, and more. If you have hundreds or thousands of devices, these filters can be very useful.

Similarly, you can filter the list using the **search box** (3). If you type `nh-demo` in the search box, the list will display only the devices that contain the string `nh-demo`.

You can use the **Select an action** dropdown bulk operations, like deleting items (4).

## Bulk Actions

<ThemedImage
    alt="Bulk actions dropdown"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/device-actions-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/device-actions-dark.png'),
    }}
    style={{ width: '70%' }} 
/>

Click the **Select an action** dropdown to see several bulk action choices. You can select one or more devices and click the **hammer icon** to execute an action.

You will find bulk actions available for most Device42 objects, but the options will vary for each object.

## Detail View

All objects in Device42 have a list view, a detail view, and an edit view. Most objects also have a **History (Audit Logs)** button that shows a history of changes to the object.

On the Devices list page, click on the **Name** of a device to view its details.  

<ThemedImage
    alt="View device details"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/view-device-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/view-device-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

Notice the set of buttons in the top right corner of the detail view. Click the **Edit** button to open the fields for editing and additions. Click the **ellipsis menu** for related view options, including the **Impact Chart** option, which opens the topology impact chart discussed above.

Scroll further down the page to find tabs that open subpages of data for the device.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Device view tabs"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/device-tabs-light.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/tutorial-navigating-the-device42-user-interface/device-tabs-dark.png'),
    }}
/>

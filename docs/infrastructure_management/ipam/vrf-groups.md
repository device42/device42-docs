## About VRF Groups

For those wondering 'what does VRF stand for', the term "VRF Groups" is short for "Virtual Routing & Forwarding Groups". VRF Groups are often utilized by ISPs and other larger network service providers to organize and track customers' (or their own) logical networks segments, subnets, and VLANs, some of which often overlap with IP ranges in use in other VRF groups -- _but never within the same VRF group_. The reason why is quite simple: There are really only 3 IP address ranges dedicated for use in private networks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16; however, there are thousands of end users on these networks that need to route traffic to the internet -- and in a few special cases, to each other. VRF groups to the rescue!

Most VRF groups are designed so that they can't route between each other by default; however, all are able to route out to a larger network cloud (e.g. _the internet_), thus allowing multiple customers to assign IP addresses to end users on their own networks as they please -- without interfering with one another.

Device42 users can create VRF groups in Device42 to track and manage these overlapping IP Ranges via the main menu, _Network -> VRF Group_. Simply assign networks to VRF groups as appropriate, dividing your individual networks into VRF groups. IP addresses must be unique _per VRF group_, but **you can have overlapping subnet ranges** across VRF groups.

## Add/Edit a VRF Group page

![Add new VRF group](/assets/images/Add-VRF-group-v15HL.png)

**Name:** is required and must be unique among VRF groups.  
**Description:** Free form text to enter any text.  
**Default:** Select this checkbox to have all subnets auto-discovered added to this VRF group automatically (going forward). This option will \*not\* add existing subnets automatically. _Note that subnets are not displayed on the edit page._

If you make the VRF Group the default, then subnets and IP's will be automatically assigned to this default VRF group – unless otherwise specified.

## View an existing VRF Group
